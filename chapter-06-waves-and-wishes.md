# Chapter 6: Truth at the Campfire

Evening campfire is a Camp Silver Lake tradition. The whole camp gathers around the stone fire pit, roasting marshmallows while counselors play guitar.

It should be peaceful. It would be, if I could shake this morning's confrontation with Jamie.

I sit on a log bench between Betty and other girls from Cabin Seven, marshmallow extended toward the flames. Someone starts "Kumbaya," and voices join in, some enthusiastic, some halfhearted.

I'm definitely halfhearted.

Across the fire, Michael sits with the other counselors. Even in the flickering firelight, he's handsome.

I watch him through the flames.

"You're staring again," Betty whispers.

"I know."

"Are you okay? You've been quiet all day."

"Just thinking."

About Jamie's words. About whether I'm wasting my summer on a fantasy.

The song ends. Mrs. Morrison announces tomorrow's scavenger hunt. Then Michael takes over the guitar, and the crowd perks up immediately.

"Requests?" he asks, and about fifteen girls shout suggestions at once.

He picks "I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling," and his voice is as good as everything else about him—warm, steady, with just enough roughness to make it interesting. I watch his fingers move across the strings, watch the firelight play across his features, and let myself drift into the fantasy.

What would it be like if he was singing to me? If those warm eyes focused on me instead of the crowd? If—

Someone plops down on the log beside me, too close, crowding into my space.

I know who it is before I even look.

"Cozy gathering," Jamie says cheerfully, helping himself to the marshmallow bag Betty left on the bench. "Nothing like a campfire to bring out everyone's sentimental side."

"This seat's taken," I say through gritted teeth.

"By who? I don't see anyone." He spears a marshmallow and holds it toward the fire. "Oh wait, were you saving it for Golden Boy? Because I hate to break it to you, but he's pretty settled over there with the other counselors."

Betty glances between us, eyebrows raised, but says nothing.

"Go away, Jamie."

"Can't. Fire's for everyone." He grins at Betty. "Hi, I'm Jamie Sullivan."

"Betty Wilson. You're the one with the rope swing."

"Guilty. You're the one trying to set Lily up with the swimming instructor."

Betty's eyes widen. "How did you—"

"I'm observant." He pulls his marshmallow from the fire—perfectly golden—and makes a s'more. "So how's that going? The Michael campaign?"

"There's no campaign," I hiss, hyperaware that other people can hear us.

"Right, right. You just coincidentally show up early to swimming, coincidentally volunteer to help set up, coincidentally stare at him during campfire like he's a movie star."

My face burns hotter than the fire. "You don't know anything."

"I know you're wasting your time."

Betty makes a small noise that might be agreement but tries to cover it with a cough.

"Why do you care?" I demand, finally turning to look at Jamie directly. In the firelight, his features are softer, less mocking, but his eyes are serious.

"Because it's painful to watch."

"Then don't watch."

"Kind of hard not to. You're not exactly subtle." He takes a bite of s'more, somehow managing to eat it without getting marshmallow all over his face. "Let me ask you something—what exactly is your plan here? What's the endgame?"

"I don't have a plan."

"Exactly. You're just...what? Hoping he'll magically notice you one day? Fall madly in love with a sixteen-year-old camper? Risk his job, his reputation, his future for someone he met a week ago?"

Each question lands like a blow. I don't have answers because I haven't thought that far ahead. I've been living in the moment—the hand on my arm, the sound of my name, the warm smile. I haven't considered what comes after, because there is no after.

"Maybe I'm just enjoying camp," I say weakly.

"Are you? Because from where I'm sitting, you look miserable. You barely talk to anyone except Betty, you spend all your time either reading alone or stalking swimming lessons, and you're building this whole fantasy in your head about someone who sees you as a helpful kid."

"Stop." My voice cracks.

"I'm serious, Lily. What are you doing? Do you even talk to him? Like, actually talk to him, have conversations about things that matter?"

"This morning we—"

"Talked about kickboards and how organized you are. Yeah, I heard. Riveting stuff." He leans closer, voice dropping so only I can hear. "Do you know anything real about him? His favorite book? What he wants to do after college? Whether he has a girlfriend back at school? Anything?"

I don't. I realize with sinking certainty that I don't know anything about Michael except that he's handsome and kind and makes my heart race when he smiles.

"That's what I thought," Jamie says, but not unkindly. "You're not falling for him. You're falling for the idea of him. And that's fine, except you're spending your whole summer on it instead of actually living."

"Why do you care?" I ask again, but this time it's genuine curiosity, not anger. "Why does it matter to you what I do?"

Jamie is quiet for a moment, watching the fire. When he speaks, his voice is different—less teasing, more honest.

"Because I know what it's like to hide. To build walls and keep people at arm's length and tell yourself it's safer that way. And yeah, it is safer. But it's also lonely as hell. And you—" he gestures at me with his s'more "—you seem like someone who deserves better than spending eight weeks pining for someone who'll never look at you the way you want."

The words should sting, but they don't. Coming from Jamie, right now, they almost sound like concern.

"How would you know what I deserve?"

"I don't. But I know you love books enough to be upset when one gets ruined. I know you're organized and thoughtful and probably smarter than half the people here. I know you're scared of being noticed, but you're also desperate to be seen. That's a hell of a contradiction, and it's interesting."

I stare at him. "You got all that from ruining my book and crashing my swim class?"

"I'm observant, remember?" He finishes his s'more and starts making another one. "Look, I'm not trying to be mean. I'm trying to tell you the truth, because apparently no one else will. Michael Grant is a nice guy. Emphasis on guy—as in, too old for you. And even if he wasn't, you're a fantasy to yourself. You don't actually want him. You want the safety of wanting someone you can't have."

The accuracy of that statement steals my breath.

"That's not—"

"It is. Think about it. If Michael actually showed interest, you'd panic. Because then it'd be real, and real things can hurt you. Safe fantasy crush means you can never be rejected, never be disappointed, never have to risk anything." He looks at me, and in the firelight his expression is surprisingly gentle. "But you're also never going to get anything real."

Around us, the campfire continues. Michael has started a new song, voices rising in chorus. Betty is pointedly examining her marshmallow, giving us space.

"What would you know about real?" I ask quietly.

Jamie's smile turns sad. "Not much. That's how I know what hiding looks like."

We sit in silence for a moment. The fire crackles. Someone laughs at a joke I didn't hear. The smell of burnt sugar and wood smoke fills the air.

"I don't know how to be different," I admit, the words barely audible.

"Start by actually talking to people. Not helping with equipment or volunteering for demonstrations—actually talking. Ask questions. Share things about yourself. Be real instead of invisible." He pauses. "You could start with me, if you want. I'm an easy target. Already think you're interesting."

I look at him, trying to figure out if he's mocking me. But his expression is open, genuine.

"Why would you want to talk to me? I've been nothing but rude to you."

"Because you're honest about it. You don't pretend. I like that." He holds out the marshmallow bag. "Want to make a s'more? Actual  food helps conversations."

Despite everything—the confrontation, the uncomfortable truths, the way he's systematically dismantled my safe fantasy—I take the bag.

"Fine. But if you mock my marshmallow-roasting technique, I'm leaving."

"Deal."

We make s'mores in silence. His marshmallow catches fire and he laughs. Mine comes out perfect, golden brown.

"Show-off," he mutters, grinning.

Michael finishes his song. People applaud. I watch him—beautiful, kind, unattainable—and something in my chest loosens. Jamie's right. Michael is a fantasy, safe because he's impossible.

"What if I don't know how to do this?" I ask quietly. "Be real? Risk things?"

"Then you fake it until you do. That's what everyone else is doing anyway." Jamie offers me graham crackers. "And maybe you stop spending all your energy on someone who'll never see you, and start spending it on actually living your summer."

"Is this your way of volunteering to be my friend?"

"Maybe. Is it working?"

I assemble my s'more, considering. Jamie is loud and disruptive and says things that make me uncomfortable. He's also honest and surprisingly perceptive and the first person besides Betty to actually seem interested in talking to me.

"It's not not working," I admit.

He grins, that genuine smile that transforms his whole face. "I'll take it."

The campfire winds down. Mrs. Morrison announces lights-out in thirty minutes. Jamie stands and brushes crumbs off his jeans.

"See you tomorrow, book girl. Try not to spend the whole night analyzing our conversation."

"No promises."

He laughs and jogs off, leaving me with Betty.

Betty waits exactly three seconds. "Okay, what was that?"

"I have no idea."

"He likes you."

"He thinks I'm pathetic for liking Michael."

"Those aren't mutually exclusive." Betty links her arm through mine. "He also has a point about Michael."

"I know."

"So what are you going to do?"

I look back at the dying fire. Michael laughs at something Dorothy said, comfortable and friendly, exactly as he is with everyone.

"I don't know yet," I admit.

But as Betty and I walk back to our cabin under a sky full of stars, I realize something has shifted. The fantasy doesn't feel quite as safe as it did this morning.

And Jamie Sullivan, annoying troublemaker, might have just become something unexpected.

A friend.

Maybe.
