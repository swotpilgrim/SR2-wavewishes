# Chapter 25: Recognition and Realization

Jamie holds the book between us, its leather cover warm from his hands and mine.

"I started this after you told me about your parents," he says. "That night when you admitted why you read so much, why you disappear into books. I saw myself in that—hiding in different ways, but hiding just the same."

"You hide in chaos," I say. "I hide in quiet."

"Exactly." He nods. "But we were both doing the same thing. Protecting ourselves from being seen and found wanting."

The words land with uncomfortable accuracy because they're true. We've been dancing around each other all summer, two people who understand hiding better than we understand being honest.

"When did you know?" I ask. "When did you realize you were falling for me?"

Jamie's quiet for a moment, thinking. "You remember that day with Jane Eyre? When I soaked your book?"

"How could I forget? You ruined it."

"You got so mad." A smile crosses his face. "Really, genuinely mad. Not laughing-at-the-troublemaker mad. Not oh-that's-just-Jamie mad. You looked at me like I was a real person who'd done a real shitty thing that mattered."

"You had."

"I know. And you called me on it. You didn't let me deflect with a joke or charm my way out. You just..." He trails off, searching for words. "You treated me like someone capable of better. Like I was more than the role I've been playing."

I think about that day, about how annoyed I was. I'd been trying to disappear with my book, and Jamie had literally crashed into my peace. At the time, I thought I was just being cranky.

"That mattered to you?"

"It was the first time in years someone looked past the act." His voice is quiet but certain. "Everyone else just laughs when I cause trouble or rolls their eyes and walks away. But you expected more from me. That felt... significant."

"So you decided to fall for the grumpy girl who yelled at you?"

"I decided to pay attention to her. The falling happened on its own." He grins. "Every conversation after that just made it worse. You were smart and funny and saw things other people missed. You had all this fire hiding under the quiet. I wanted to know everything about you."

My chest feels tight. "I didn't see it. I was so focused on Michael that I missed you entirely."

"You saw me," Jamie corrects. "You just didn't let yourself admit what it meant. All those talks we had, all those moments at our spot by the rocks or here on this dock—you were paying attention too. You remember details from our conversations. You ask me questions about things I mentioned weeks ago. You see me, Lily. You just called it friendship because that felt safer."

He's right. I have been paying attention. I know he sketches when he's anxious. I know his favorite time of day is early morning before everyone wakes up. I know he's terrified of disappointing people even though he pretends not to care. I know his laugh changes depending on whether it's real or performative.

I know him.

"I've been an idiot," I say.

"You've been scared." He sets the book aside carefully. "There's a difference. Michael was safe because he was impossible. You could pine for him without risking anything real. But me? I pay attention and ask questions and won't let you hide. That's terrifying when your whole identity is built on being invisible."

"You sound like you've thought about this a lot."

"I've had all summer to think about it." He turns to face me more fully. "Watching you chase someone who was never going to see you while I was right here hoping you'd look my way just once. It was frustrating and painful and educational."

Guilt stabs through me. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry I made you wait all summer, made you watch me be stupid about Michael when you were—"

"Don't apologize." He reaches for my hand again. "You needed time to figure it out. I get that. I was hiding too, just in a different way. At least you were brave enough to have feelings, even if they were for the wrong person. I was too scared to do anything but write stories and hope you'd eventually notice me."

"Your poem," I say, remembering. "Tonight, when you performed it. That was you being brave."

"That was me being terrified." He laughs. "I stood up there shaking, knowing everyone would know exactly who I was talking about. Knowing you'd know. That was the scariest thing I've ever done."

"Scarier than all your pranks?"

"Pranks are easy. They're designed to get a reaction without risking anything real. But standing on that stage and reciting words about how someone made me want to be better, want to be seen, want to create instead of destroy?" He shakes his head. "That was me completely vulnerable in front of everyone. No jokes, no deflection, just honest feelings."

I think about how he looked up there—nervous but determined, his voice steady even though I could see his hands shaking. He did that for me. Put himself out there completely.

"And then I ran away," I say, shame flooding through me.

"You ran away from Michael's announcement. Not from me." Jamie squeezes my hand. "I watched you at the lighting board during my poem. I saw your face, Lily. You weren't horrified or embarrassed. You were crying."

"I was overwhelmed. By how beautiful it was, how brave you were being, how much it meant that you wrote it for me." I wipe at my eyes. "And then Michael made his announcement and I realized everyone knew about him and Dorothy except me, and I felt so stupid and humiliated that I just... fled."

"I know. Betty told me you were upset about Michael, not about my poem."

"Betty talks too much."

"Betty cares about you." He grins. "She came to find me after you ran. Said I should probably go check on you because you were having a realization and I'd want to be there for it."

"A realization?"

"That you've been chasing the wrong guy all summer." His voice is gentle. "That the person you thought you wanted wasn't real, but the person who's been right here is."

He's giving me an opening. A chance to say what we both know but haven't spoken directly yet.

I take a breath. "I've been falling for you, Jamie. Probably since that scavenger hunt when we accidentally made a good team. Or maybe that night on the dock when we told each other real things about our families. I don't know exactly when it started. I just know that somewhere along the way, you stopped being the annoying boy who ruined my book and became the person I looked for first at every meal, every activity, every moment."

His eyes widen. "Lily—"

"I called it friendship because friendship was safe. Friends can't break your heart the way someone you're falling for can. But I was lying to myself." I squeeze his hand. "You're more than my friend. You've been more than my friend for weeks. I was just too scared to admit it."

"And now?"

"Now I'm still scared. Probably more scared than I've ever been in my life." I meet his eyes. "But I'm tired of hiding. I'm tired of wasting my summer—my life—on safe fantasies. You're real and present and you see me completely. That's terrifying. But it's also the best thing that's ever happened to me."

Jamie's quiet for a long moment, just looking at me. Then he lifts my hand and presses a kiss to my palm—soft and deliberate.

"I see you," he says. "The real you, complete with all your fears and walls and tendency to hide in books. And I'm not going anywhere."

"You can't promise that. We're going home in a few days. You live three hours away. We'll be at different schools, living different lives—"

"So we'll write letters. Make phone calls. Visit when we can." He says it like it's simple, like logistics are just problems to be solved rather than insurmountable obstacles. "My mom's new family is actually closer to your town than you think. I'm there every other weekend. We can figure this out if you want to."

"If I want to?"

"It has to be your choice, Lily. I can't convince you to take a risk. You have to decide you're willing to try."

I think about the summer I planned—hiding with books, staying invisible, maybe crushing safely on some unattainable boy. That summer would have ended with me exactly where I started: alone and protected and unchanged.

But the summer I actually had changed everything. Jamie made me laugh and think and question myself. He saw past my walls and made me want to be brave. He created art inspired by our conversations and wrote poetry about finding unexpected connection.

He made me want to risk everything for something real.

"I want to," I hear myself say. "I'm terrified, but I want to try. I want us to try."

His whole face lights up with that real smile that transforms him. "Yeah?"

"Yeah." I'm smiling too now, tears and all. "I don't know how to do this. I've never done this before. But with you, I want to figure it out."

"We'll figure it out together." He threads his fingers through mine more firmly. "That's what people who care about each other do. They figure things out. Together."

Together. The word feels like a promise.

We sit there on the dock with our hands linked and his book of stories between us, and for the first time all summer, I'm not thinking about what-ifs or maybes. I'm not building fantasies or planning escape routes.

I'm just here. Present. Real.

With someone who sees me completely and chooses me anyway.

The stars wheel overhead. The water laps gently at the dock posts. And somewhere in my chest, something that's been clenched tight for months finally unclenches.

This is what being seen feels like.

This is what choosing reality over fantasy feels like.

And it's better—so much better—than any safe crush could ever be.
