# Chapter 26: Truth Under Starlight

We stay on the dock talking until the stars shift position, until the camp goes completely quiet, until the only sounds are water and night birds and our own voices.

"Tell me something true," Jamie says. It's become our thing, a way we start the conversations that matter.

"I'm scared of going home," I admit. "To my parents and their fighting. Coming here made me realize how much I was hiding there too. I've spent my whole life trying to be invisible so I don't become another thing for them to argue about."

Jamie's quiet, his thumb tracing circles on my hand. "Do they know you feel that way?"

"I don't think they notice me enough to know. They're so busy being disappointed in each other that I just fade into the background. Which is what I wanted, except now I realize that being invisible at home made me think I had to be invisible everywhere."

"But you're not invisible. Not to me."

"I know." I squeeze his hand. "That's what's so scary and wonderful about this. You see me, really see me, and you're still here. You haven't decided I'm too much work or too complicated or too quiet."

"Why would I? You're perfect as you are."

"I'm not perfect—"

"You're perfect for me," he clarifies. "Complicated and quiet and hiding behind books. I like all of it."

The acceptance in his voice makes my throat tight. My parents barely see me. But Jamie knows exactly who I am and wants me anyway.

"Your turn," I say. "Tell me something true."

He takes a breath. "I'm terrified my dad's going to follow through on the military school threat. Part of me thinks maybe that's what I deserve. Maybe if they send me away, I'll finally be worth keeping."

"Jamie, no—"

"I know it's messed up. But when you grow up feeling like an inconvenience, like your parents would be happier if you didn't exist, you start believing maybe they're right. Maybe I am the problem." His voice cracks slightly. "Maybe if I was better, less trouble, more what they wanted, they wouldn't have left."

"They didn't leave because of you. They left because they couldn't stay with each other."

"Except they both moved on so fast. New relationships, new families. And I'm just the leftover piece from their failed marriage that they shuffle back and forth because someone has to take me."

I turn to face him more fully. "Listen to me. You are not a problem to be solved. You're a person—a smart, creative, funny person who happens to cause trouble because you're hurting and don't know how else to make people pay attention. But that doesn't make you defective. It makes you human."

"You sound very sure about that."

"I am sure. Because I know you now. The real you, not the troublemaker act. And the real you is someone worth knowing. Someone worth keeping." I pause. "Your parents are the ones who are messed up, not you."

He laughs, but it sounds watery. "We're quite a pair, aren't we? Two kids with broken families trying to figure out how to be whole."

"Maybe that's why we work. We understand each other's damage."

"Is that what you think this is? Two damaged people finding comfort?"

"No." I say it firmly. "I think this is two people who've been hiding finally being brave enough to be seen. And yes, we both have family stuff that hurts. But that doesn't define us. We get to choose who we become."

"Who do you want to become?"

The question catches me off guard. I've spent so long just trying to survive, to stay invisible and safe, that I haven't thought about who I want to be.

"I want to be braver," I say finally. "I want to stop hiding behind books and fantasies. I want to let people see me and risk getting hurt because that's how you have real connections." I look at him. "You made me want that. Made me realize that safety isn't worth it if you're alone."

"You're not alone. Not anymore."

"Neither are you."

We sit with that truth for a while. Two people who've felt invisible our whole lives, finally seeing each other.

"What about you?" I ask. "Who do you want to become?"

Jamie's quiet, thinking. "I want to create things. Stories, art, something meaningful. I'm tired of being known for destruction. You made me realize I'm good at creating when I actually try. That maybe I don't have to be the troublemaker if I can be something else instead."

"You could be an artist. A writer."

"Maybe. If my dad doesn't ship me off to military school first." He sighs. "He says I need discipline, structure, someone to straighten me out. But I think he just wants me to be someone else's problem."

"What does your mom say?"

"She agrees with him. Says maybe it would be good for me to learn respect and responsibility." His voice goes flat. "They're both on the same page for once, just about getting rid of me."

The pain in his words breaks my heart. "When would you have to go?"

"This fall. If they go through with it. They're still 'considering options,' which is parent-speak for 'we're definitely doing it, we just haven't told you yet.'"

"Three hours suddenly doesn't seem so far," I say. "Military school would be..."

"Farther. Different state. Letters and phone calls only." He squeezes my hand. "That's why I almost didn't tell you how I felt. What's the point of starting something if it's going to end in September?"

"The point is that it matters now. This summer matters. What we have matters, even if logistics are complicated."

"You really believe that?"

"I have to. Otherwise what's the point? If we only do things that are easy and guaranteed, we'll never do anything real."

"I really am falling for you," he says. "Completely. Terrifyingly. I've never felt this way about anyone."

"Me neither." It's the truest thing I've said all night. "Michael was just fantasy. But you? You matter. What you think matters. The idea of losing you actually hurts, like physically hurts in my chest." I press my hand to my heart. "That's how I know it's real. Because losing it would actually break something."

Jamie's eyes are bright in the starlight. "I won't disappear. Even if they send me away, I'll write. I'll call when I can. I'll figure out visits. You won't lose me that easily."

"Promise?"

"Promise. You're stuck with me, Lily Palmer. Whether you like it or not."

"I like it." I lean my head against his shoulder, and he wraps his arm around me. "I really, really like it."

We stay like that, wrapped in each other and starlight and promises we hope we can keep. The night air is cool but his arm is warm. The dock is hard wood but I've never been more comfortable.

Above us, the stars wheel slowly through their ancient patterns. Cassiopeia, Orion, the Big Dipper. The same constellations that have witnessed countless summer romances at countless camps. But this one is ours.

"What are you thinking?" Jamie asks after a long silence.

"That I'm glad I came to camp. Even though I spent the first half hiding and pining for the wrong person. Even though it took me forever to figure out what was right in front of me. I'm glad I was here to meet you."

"I'm glad I was here to find you." He presses a kiss to the top of my head. "Even if you did yell at me about a wet book."

"I had every right to yell. You ruined Jane Eyre."

"I know. But it got your attention."

"Is that why you did it? To get my attention?"

"Honestly? At the time, no. I was just being my usual chaotic self. But in retrospect, yeah. I wanted you to notice me. I wanted you to see me as more than just the camp troublemaker."

"Mission accomplished."

He laughs, and I feel it vibrate through his chest. "Best summer of my life," he says. "Hands down. No contest."

"Me too," I admit. "Which is weird because I spent most of it hiding or chasing the wrong person. But somehow it still ended up being perfect."

"That's because the ending is what matters. And this?" He squeezes me closer. "This is a pretty perfect ending."

"It's not an ending. Summer's not over yet."

"True. We still have a few more days."

"And then?"

"And then we figure out what comes next. Together."

Together. I'm starting to love that word.

We stay on the dock until we hear voices from camp—counselors doing final rounds, making sure everyone's in their cabins. We stand reluctantly, hands still linked, neither wanting to break the spell.

"Tomorrow?" Jamie asks.

"Tomorrow," I confirm.

We walk back together through the sleeping camp, and at the fork where our paths divide, he pulls me close one more time.

"Thank you," he says.

"For what?"

"For seeing me. For being brave enough to admit it. For choosing something real even though it's scary."

"Thank you for waiting. For not giving up even when I was being an idiot about Michael."

"You weren't an idiot. You were protecting yourself."

"I was being an idiot. But I'm done with that now."

He grins. "Good. Because I have plans for our last few days at camp, and they all involve you actually noticing I exist."

"I notice. I promise I notice."

"Good." He squeezes my hand one final time before letting go. "Sweet dreams, Lily Palmer."

"Sweet dreams, Jamie Sullivan."

I watch him disappear toward the boys' cabins, then turn toward my own. When I slip inside, Betty's awake, sitting up in her bunk.

"Well?" she whispers. "Are you finally together?"

"Yeah," I whisper back, unable to stop smiling. "We're together."

"Finally! I've been waiting forever for you two to figure it out."

I climb into my bunk, and for the first time since arriving at Camp Silver Lake, I don't reach for a book before sleeping.

I don't need to escape into stories anymore.

Because my own story is finally getting good.
