# Chapter 29: The Final Bonfire

The bonfire burns down to embers as the last songs fade away. People linger, nobody wanting to be the first to leave. This is it—the final moment before everything changes.

Jamie's arm is still around my shoulders. We've been sitting like this for over an hour, close and comfortable, and I never want to move.

Mrs. Morrison stands for one final announcement.

"Before we say goodnight, I have something to share. A tradition we do every final bonfire." She holds up a box. "Inside are paper and pens. I want each of you to write down something you're taking home from this summer. Not a thing—a lesson, a memory, a promise to yourself. Something that will remind you of who you became at Camp Silver Lake."

She passes the box around. People take paper and pens, thinking carefully about what to write.

When the box reaches me, I take a sheet and stare at it. What am I taking home?

I look at Jamie beside me, at Betty across the fire, at the dock visible in the distance. I think about the girl who arrived eight weeks ago—quiet, hiding, choosing fantasy over reality.

I write: *I learned that being seen is better than being safe.*

Jamie's writing too, his careful handwriting filling the page. He folds his paper before I can read it, but he catches me looking and smiles.

"What did you write?" I whisper.

"That I learned to create instead of destroy. That someone can see all your damage and still choose you." He touches my hand. "That real things are worth the risk."

My throat goes tight.

Mrs. Morrison collects the papers. "These will stay with me, reminders of this summer, this group, this moment. But the lessons you wrote—those you keep. Those go home with you."

She feeds the papers to the dying fire one by one. They catch and burn, smoke rising into the star-filled sky. It feels symbolic—releasing the old selves, carrying forward only what matters.

As the last paper burns, Mrs. Morrison speaks one final time.

"Thank you for trusting us with your summer. Thank you for being brave enough to show up, try new things, make friends, take risks. You came as strangers. You leave as family. Remember that. Remember each other. Remember who you are when you're brave."

The camp applauds, and suddenly people are hugging, crying, making last promises to write. The formal bonfire is over, but nobody wants to leave.

Jamie pulls me close. "Come with me? One more time?"

I know where he means. "The dock?"

"The dock."

We slip away as others say goodbyes. The path to the lake is familiar in the dark—we've walked it dozens of times this summer. The dock stretches out over black water, the same as always, but tonight it feels different.

Final.

We sit at the end, feet dangling over the edge. Stars reflect on the water. The bonfire glows behind us, slowly fading.

"Tomorrow we leave," I say. "Back to real life."

"Real life won't be like this. No lake, no dock, no summer magic."

"Do you think we'll make it? When things get hard and we're three hours apart and we haven't seen each other in weeks?"

Jamie's quiet for a moment. "I think if we want to make it, we will. It won't be easy. We'll miss each other. We'll fight sometimes. There will be moments when keeping this alive feels impossible. But if we both want it enough, we'll figure it out."

"I want it enough."

"Me too." He turns to face me. "Lily, I need to tell you something. Before we leave, before reality gets complicated."

My heart speeds up. "Okay."

"This summer changed me. You changed me. I came here expecting to cause trouble and count down the days. Instead, I met you, and you made me want to be better. You made me create things instead of destroy them. You saw past my act and made me believe I was worth seeing."

"Jamie—"

"Let me finish." He takes both my hands. "I love you. I'm in love with you. I probably have been since you yelled at me about Jane Eyre, but I know for sure now. And I needed to say it before we leave, before I lose my nerve, because you deserve to know how completely you matter to me."

The words hit like a tidal wave. He loves me. Jamie Sullivan loves me.

"You love me?" My voice comes out small.

"Completely. Terrifyingly. More than I've ever loved anyone." His eyes are bright in the starlight. "You don't have to say it back. I just needed you to know."

But I do need to say it back. Because it's true.

"I love you too," I whisper. "I don't know when it started exactly. Maybe that night we talked about our families. Maybe the scavenger hunt. Maybe every conversation we've had. But I know I love you. Real, scary, overwhelming love."

Jamie's smile is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

"Say it again."

"I love you, Jamie Sullivan."

"Again."

"I love you."

He cups my face gently, his thumb tracing my cheekbone. "I'm going to kiss you now. If that's okay."

"That's more than okay."

He leans in slowly, giving me time to change my mind. But I don't want to change my mind. I want this. I want him.

Our lips meet, soft and sweet and perfect. My first kiss. His first real kiss, he told me once. It's gentle and a little awkward and absolutely right.

When we pull apart, we're both grinning.

"That was—" I start.

"Perfect," he finishes. "That was perfect."

We kiss again, and this time it's less awkward. More confident. My hand finds his hair, his arms wrap around me, and for a moment the world is just us and stars and the gentle lap of water against wood.

When we finally break apart, I'm breathless and dizzy and so happy I could burst.

"We should probably head back," Jamie says reluctantly. "Before they send search parties."

"Probably."

But neither of us moves. We sit there a little longer, foreheads pressed together, breathing the same air.

"Promise me something," I say.

"Anything."

"Promise this isn't just summer. Promise we'll try to make it real after we leave."

"I promise. Letters every week. Phone calls when we can. Visits whenever possible. This isn't just summer, Lily. This is real. You're real. We're real."

"Okay." I kiss him once more, quick and sweet. "Okay."

We walk back to camp holding hands. Most people have headed to their cabins, but a few stragglers remain by the dying bonfire. Betty sees us and grins knowingly.

At the fork where our paths split, Jamie pulls me close one more time.

"Tomorrow's going to be chaos. Packing, goodbyes, parents arriving. I might not get another moment alone with you."

"So make this one count."

He kisses me again, longer this time, like he's memorizing the feel of it. When we finally pull apart, both our eyes are wet.

"I love you," he says. "Remember that tomorrow when things are crazy. Remember tonight."

"I love you too. I'll remember."

"Write me as soon as you get home."

"I will. You write me back."

"Every single time."

One more kiss, quick and desperate and full of promises. Then he walks toward the boys' cabins and I head to mine.

Betty's waiting up when I slip inside.

"Well?" she whispers.

"Well what?"

"Did he kiss you?"

I can't help smiling. "Yeah. He kissed me."

"And?"

"And it was perfect. Everything was perfect."

She squeals quietly. "I knew it! I knew you two were endgame!"

"Endgame?"

"Made for each other. Meant to be. True love. Whatever you want to call it."

True love. The phrase should sound ridiculous. We're sixteen and seventeen, we've known each other eight weeks, we're going home tomorrow to complicated lives three hours apart.

But it doesn't sound ridiculous. It sounds exactly right.

"Get some sleep," Betty says. "Tomorrow's going to be emotional enough without being tired."

I climb into my bunk and lie there, too wired to sleep. My lips still tingle from Jamie's kisses. My hand still feels warm from holding his. My heart still races from hearing him say he loves me.

I love you, Jamie Sullivan.

And somehow, impossibly, he loves me back.

The summer I came here hiding from life, trying to be invisible, choosing fantasy over reality—that summer turned into something I never expected.

It turned into the summer I learned to be seen.

The summer I learned that real things, scary as they are, are so much better than safe fantasies.

The summer I fell in love.

Tomorrow we leave. Tomorrow reality begins. Tomorrow we'll be tested by distance and time and all the complications of real life.

But tonight, lying in my bunk with my cabin-mates sleeping around me and the taste of Jamie's kiss still on my lips, I'm not scared.

I'm ready.

For whatever comes next.

Together.
