# Chapter 1: The Reluctant Arrival

The backseat of my parents' station wagon smells like warm vinyl and disappointment. I clutch my suitcase closer, pressing my cheek against the window, watching the Michigan countryside blur past in shades of green. Fifty-six days. Eight weeks. That's all I have to survive before I can go home again.

"I told you to turn left at the last intersection, Harold."

"The sign said Silver Lake Road was ahead, Margaret."

"The *old* sign. They moved it two years ago, remember?"

I close my eyes. Even here, even on the way to dump me at summer camp, they can't stop. It's never shouting—that would require actual passion. It's this low-level, constant picking, like water wearing down stone. I learned years ago that the safest response is silence, invisibility. If they can't see me, they can't pull me into it.

"There's the new sign now," my father says, his voice tight with satisfaction.

My mother says nothing, which is somehow worse than arguing back.

I run my hand over the suitcase's hard edge. Inside are the things that matter: three dresses for evening activities, shorts and blouses for daytime, my blue swimsuit that I'll probably never wear, and—most importantly—my books. Jane Eyre, The Secret Garden, Pride and Prejudice, and four others I begged my mother to let me pack. She'd frowned at the weight but relented when I promised not to complain about anything else.

Books don't fight. Books don't look at you with that expression that says you're the reason everything went wrong. Books are safe.

The station wagon turns onto a dirt road, and suddenly we're surrounded by tall pines that block out the afternoon sun. A painted wooden sign announces "Camp Silver Lake - Est. 1932" in cheerful letters that make my stomach clench. Through the trees, I can already hear it—shrieking, laughing, the chaos of a hundred girls reuniting after a year apart.

"Oh, how exciting!" My mother turns in her seat, her smile too bright. "Look at all the activity, Lily. You're going to have such a wonderful time."

I manage a nod. She wants me to have a wonderful time because then she won't feel guilty about shipping me off so she and my father can have the summer to themselves. Maybe without me there, they'll fight less. Or maybe they'll finally fight enough to end it. Either way, I won't have to watch.

The parking area is pure chaos. Station wagons and sedans jockey for space while girls pour out of vehicles, trunks pop open, and counselors with clipboards direct traffic like they're orchestrating a symphony. Everyone seems to know someone—there are squeals of "I missed you!" and girls hugging like they've been separated for years instead of months. Camp stickers from previous summers decorate trunks and suitcases. A portable radio somewhere plays Elvis, adding to the carnival atmosphere.

I shrink back against the seat. This was a terrible idea.

"Come on, sweetheart." My father opens my door, already checking his watch. They have a long drive home and dinner reservations, because of course they do. They planned a nice evening out the moment they got rid of me.

I grab my suitcase and climb out. My mother fusses with my collar, smoothing my hair behind my ears. "Remember to brush your teeth twice a day. And write us every week—you promised. And try to make friends, Lily. Really try."

The way she says it makes me feel like there's something wrong with me for not being the kind of girl who can walk into a crowd and instantly belong.

"I will," I lie.

My father hefts my trunk from the back. "Where do we take this?"

A counselor with a sunny smile and a clipboard bounces over. "New camper? What cabin?"

"Seven," I whisper, clutching the paper they sent in May.

"Pine Grove, perfect! Just drop the trunk there by the flagpole. The girls will help haul everything to cabins after orientation." She checks me off on her list. "You must be Lily Palmer! Welcome to Camp Silver Lake. You're going to have the best summer of your life!"

I seriously doubt that, but I nod anyway.

My father sets down my trunk with obvious relief. My mother gives me one more hug, holding on just a second too long, which makes me wonder if she's actually going to miss me or just feels obligated to pretend. Then they're back in the station wagon, my father already backing up while my mother waves through the window.

I stand there, alone with my suitcase and trunk, watching them disappear down the pine-lined road.

Around me, the chaos continues. Girls are everywhere—tall ones, short ones, blondes and brunettes and redheads, all of them confident and loud and so completely comfortable in their own skin. They wear pedal pushers and bright blouses, bobby socks and saddle shoes, their ponytails bouncing as they move. I look down at my own plain white blouse and blue shorts and feel invisible, which is both a relief and deeply lonely.

"Lily Palmer?"

I turn to find a blonde girl with an infectious smile and sparkling eyes standing beside my trunk. She's wearing a yellow blouse that brings out the gold in her hair, and she has the kind of easy prettiness that probably makes life simple.

"I'm Betty Wilson! We're cabin-mates—Cabin Seven. I saw your name on the roster and thought I'd find you. Isn't this exciting? This is my third year, and let me tell you, Silver Lake is the absolute best camp in Michigan. Maybe in the whole country! Have you been to camp before?"

The words tumble out so fast I barely process them. "No," I manage. "First time."

"Oh, you're going to love it! Well, you might hate the first few days because you'll be homesick, but then you'll love it. Everyone does. Come on, I'll show you to our cabin. Leave your trunk—the counselors will bring them later. Just grab your suitcase."

She's already walking, and I have no choice but to follow, weaving between clusters of reuniting friends and counselors directing traffic. Betty keeps up a steady stream of chatter about swimming lessons and arts and crafts and something called a talent show, but I'm only half listening. I'm too busy trying to breathe through the tightness in my chest.

Pine Grove turns out to be a cluster of cabins beneath tall pine trees, exactly like the name suggests. Cabin Seven is a wooden structure with screen windows and a door that hangs slightly crooked. Inside, it smells like old wood and pine needles and faintly of mildew—the scent of a thousand summers lived by girls who came before me. Six bunk beds line the walls, and girls are already claiming spots, tossing suitcases onto mattresses and arguing cheerfully about who gets which bed. Someone has already hung a pennant on the wall that says "Silver Lake '57" in cheerful blue letters.

"Top or bottom?" Betty asks, stopping at a bunk in the far corner.

"Top," I say quickly. Top bunk means fewer people can hover over me, and this corner spot is as far from the door and the center of activity as possible.

"Perfect! I like bottom anyway." Betty tosses her suitcase onto the lower bunk, then flops down with a happy sigh. "We're going to have such a swell summer, Lily. I can tell."

I climb up to my bunk and open my suitcase carefully. While the other girls around me hang up dresses and compare swimsuits and argue over trunk space, I line up my books on the small shelf by my pillow. Jane Eyre, The Secret Garden, Pride and Prejudice, Little Women, Wuthering Heights, Rebecca, and—my secret favorite—Gone with the Wind, which took up half my suitcase but was worth it.

I run my fingers over the spines. Hello, old friends. We'll get through this together.

"Wow, you brought a lot of books." Betty has climbed halfway up the bunk ladder and is peering at my collection. "Are you a big reader?"

"Yes." I don't know what else to say. That books are the only friends I've ever really had? That I can't sleep without reading first? That fictional characters have never disappointed me the way real people have?

"That's nice. I wish I liked reading more, but I get too distracted. Oh! We should start getting ready for dinner. Orientation starts at six in the mess hall, and Mrs. Morrison—she's the camp director—hates when people are late."

She disappears back down the ladder, and I hear her chattering with other cabin-mates about who's back this year and whether the cute lifeguard returned. I stay on my bunk, pulling Jane Eyre from the shelf and opening to the first page. The familiar words settle over me like a blanket.

Through the screen window, I can see the lake in the distance, glittering gold in the late afternoon sun. Pine trees frame the view, and if I ignore the laughter and shrieks from nearby cabins, it's almost peaceful.

Fifty-six days, I remind myself. I'll stay invisible, keep my head down, spend my free time reading by that lake, and before I know it, summer will be over. I'll survive this the way I survive everything—by not being seen, not taking risks, not hoping for anything that could hurt me when it doesn't happen.

I turn the page and lose myself in Jane's world, where even orphans and governesses can find happy endings, though I've learned not to believe in those for myself.

The dinner bell rings too soon, and Betty bounces back to my bunk. "Come on! Don't want to be late on the first night."

I tuck Jane Eyre under my pillow and climb down, following Betty and the stream of girls heading toward a large wooden building I assume is the mess hall. The smell of food mixes with pine scent, and somewhere in the distance, I hear a record player spinning out a familiar tune.

This is my life now, for the next eight weeks. I just have to make it through.

One day at a time. One page at a time.

Invisible and safe, the way I know how to be.
