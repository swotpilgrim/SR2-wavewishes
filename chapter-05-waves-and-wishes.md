# Chapter 5: The Cannonball Conspiracy

I arrive at swimming early, determined to get a few minutes alone with Michael. Yesterday's moment when he touched my arm replays in my mind on an endless loop.

The waterfront is quiet. Michael sets out kickboards from the shed. When he notices me, he smiles.

"Morning, Lily. You're early."

My name again. It sounds important.

"I thought I could help set up."

"That'd be great. Can you grab those foam noodles from the shed?"

I attack the task with diligence, hyperaware of Michael nearby. When I look up, he's watching me.

"You're very organized," he observes.

"I like things...neat," I manage.

"Nothing wrong with that. Makes my job easier." He grins. "How are you finding camp so far?"

He's asking about me. Actually asking.

"It's...fine. Different from what I expected."

"Give it time. Silver Lake grows on people. By the end of summer, you won't want to leave."

If Michael says it, maybe it could be true.

"Thanks for helping," he says. "You're a lifesaver—literally." He winks, and I flush.

Other girls are starting to arrive, their chatter breaking the quiet morning. Betty waves at me from the path, and I wave back reluctantly. The moment with Michael is ending, slipping away, but I had it. A real conversation, just the two of us.

As the class gathers, I take my place at the water's edge, trying to hold onto that warm feeling.

Then I hear it—laughter, loud and disruptive.

Jamie Sullivan and Sparky Mitchell appear, carrying a rope with knots tied at intervals.

No. Please, no.

"What are you two doing?" Michael calls, his tone shifting to authoritative.

"Just adding some excitement, Grant!" Jamie grins like rules don't apply to him.

They head for the big oak tree over the deep end. Sparky starts rigging the rope to a thick branch.

"Guys, stop. That's not safe." Michael is already moving toward them, but Jamie is fast.

"It's totally safe! Watch!" Before Michael can stop him, Jamie grabs the rope, backs up for a running start, and swings out over the water.

For a moment, he's suspended in the air, rope stretched taut, arc perfect. Then he lets go at the apex, tucking into a cannonball.

The splash is spectacular.

All around me, girls start squealing—half in excitement, half in fear. Water from Jamie's landing sprays across the swimming area, reaching even those of us on shore.

Jamie surfaces, triumphant. "See? Perfectly safe!"

"That's not the point!" Michael's voice has an edge I haven't heard before. "Get out of the water. Both of you, now."

Sparky, who was preparing for his own swing, freezes halfway up the tree.

"Aw, come on, Michael. We're just having fun—"

"Now."

The single word carries weight. Jamie's grin falters slightly, but he swims to the ladder and climbs out. Sparky scrambles down from the tree, looking considerably less confident than two minutes ago.

Michael turns to address the gathered class. "Everyone, I'm sorry, but we need to cancel swimming this morning. I have to deal with a safety violation. We'll make up the class tomorrow."

A collective groan rises from the girls. I stand there, numb, watching my second chance with Michael dissolve. We had maybe thirty more seconds of our conversation before the class officially started. Now there's nothing.

As girls start dispersing, disappointed and complaining, Michael calls Jamie and Sparky over to the equipment shed. I can hear his voice—not yelling, but firm and disappointed, which somehow seems worse.

"You know the rules. No unauthorized use of camp equipment, no stunts without supervision, and absolutely no rigging ropes from trees without approval. Someone could have been seriously hurt."

"But no one was—" Jamie starts.

"That's not the point. The point is responsibility. The point is thinking about consequences before you act." Michael runs a hand through his hair, frustrated. "I'm not writing you up this time, but if it happens again, Mrs. Morrison will be involved. Understood?"

"Understood," they mumble.

"Go to breakfast. And take that rope down properly before you leave."

I watch this from a distance, fury building in my chest. Jamie ruined everything—again. Yesterday he mocked my crush on Michael, and today he destroyed my one chance to actually talk to him. It's like he has a radar for the things I care about and deliberately sabotages them.

As Michael talks to a few lingering girls, explaining about tomorrow's rescheduled class, Jamie and Sparky work on untying the rope. I wait until they're done, until they're heading up the path toward the mess hall.

Then I follow them.

I catch up just past the tree line, where the path narrows.

"Jamie!"

He turns, surprised. Sparky keeps walking, probably sensing the coming storm.

"What's your problem?" I demand.

"Excuse me?"

"This is the second time you've ruined something for me. First my book, now this."

"I ruined your swim class?" He has the audacity to look confused. "How did I ruin anything? You're still perfectly capable of swimming."

"I was talking to Michael. We were having a conversation, an actual conversation, and you had to go and—" I gesture wildly "—do that stupid stunt and ruin everything!"

Understanding dawns on his face, followed by something that looks like amusement. "Oh. I see. You were having a moment with Golden Boy."

"Don't call him that."

"Why not? That's what he is. Perfect Michael Grant with his perfect smile and his perfect patience." Jamie leans against a tree, arms crossed. "Let me guess—you helped him set up, he thanked you, made some small talk, maybe said your name a couple times?"

Every word is accurate, and that makes it worse. My face burns.

"You don't know anything."

"I know plenty. I know you're wasting your time chasing someone who sees you as a helpful kid, not as a person. I know he probably talks to every girl in that class the same way he talked to you. And I know you're watching him like a puppy waiting for scraps of attention."

That phrase again. Puppy waiting for scraps. It stings because there's truth in it, but I won't let him see that.

"At least I'm not acting like a child, pulling stupid stunts for attention."

"At least my stunts work. People notice me."

"People notice you're annoying!"

"Better than being invisible." He says it lightly, but the words land hard.

Is that what I am? Invisible? Is that how he sees me—so desperate to disappear that I don't even register as real?

"You don't understand anything," I say, hating how my voice shakes. "You crash through everything, ruining things, not caring who you hurt or what you destroy. Some of us are trying to actually enjoy camp, and you're making it impossible."

"Some of us are trying to survive camp," Jamie shoots back, his playful tone dropping. "And yeah, maybe I have fun doing it. Maybe I don't see the point in sitting around pining for someone who'll never look at you the way you want. Maybe I think that's the real waste."

"You're cruel."

"I'm honest." He pushes off from the tree. "Michael Grant is a nice guy who's nice to everyone. That's his job. He's not going to fall for a sixteen-year-old camper who helps him set up kickboards. That's not how this works."

Tears prick at my eyes, and I will them not to fall. I won't cry in front of Jamie Sullivan. I won't give him that satisfaction.

"Stay away from me," I manage.

"Kind of hard to do at a camp this size."

"Try."

I turn and walk away before he can say anything else, before the tears can actually fall, before I completely humiliate myself.

Behind me, I hear him call out: "For what it's worth, I really am sorry about your book!"

I don't respond. I just keep walking, my hands balled into fists, my chest tight with anger and hurt and the terrible suspicion that maybe, just maybe, he's right.

---

At breakfast, I sit at the far end of a table, picking at scrambled eggs I don't want. Betty finds me there, concern written across her face.

"What happened? Everyone's talking about the rope swing thing."

"Jamie Sullivan happened. Again."

"He's the one from yesterday? The book ruiner?"

"The very same. Apparently, his mission in life is to make mine miserable."

Betty sits down, lowering her voice. "Lily...can I say something?"

I nod, not trusting my voice.

"Maybe you should just...talk to Michael. Like, actually talk to him. Not help with equipment or volunteer for demonstrations, but have a real conversation. Tell him you'd like to get to know him better."

"I can't do that."

"Why not?"

"Because..." I trail off. Because if I actually try and he says no, it becomes real. The rejection becomes real. Right now, I can still imagine. I can still hope.

"Because it's scary," Betty finishes for me. "I get it. But hiding doesn't work either. You're just going to spend all summer watching him from a distance and going home with regrets."

Her words echo Jamie's, and I hate that.

"I'll think about it," I mumble.

But I know I won't. I can't. The gap between Michael Grant and Lily Palmer is too wide, too vast. He's twenty, confident, athletic, everything I'm not. Jamie was right about that much—Michael is nice to everyone. It's his job.

I've been building a fantasy in my head, and Jamie keeps forcing me to look at reality.

I push away my breakfast tray, appetite gone.

"I'm going back to the cabin. I have a headache."

Betty lets me go without argument, probably sensing I need space.

As I walk the path back to Pine Grove, I think about what Jamie said. About being invisible. About wasting my summer.

He's wrong. He has to be wrong.

Doesn't he?
