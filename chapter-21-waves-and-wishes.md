# Chapter 21: The Talent Show Crash

The mess hall doesn't look like a mess hall anymore.

Streamers hang from the rafters in red and white. The stage has proper curtains now, painted backdrops showing beach scenes. Rows of chairs face forward instead of the usual dining tables. The whole room hums with nervous, excited energy.

I take my position at the lighting board, running through my cues one last time. My hands are steady. I know every switch, every timing, every act's requirements. This part I can control.

What I can't control is the way my stomach flips knowing Jamie's performance is coming. Or the way I keep scanning the crowd for him even though I should be focused on my job.

The show starts promptly at seven. Mrs. Morrison welcomes everyone, counselors and campers packed into every available seat. Michael sits in the front row with Dorothy, both beaming with pride at their production.

I flip switches on cue as acts proceed. The first performance is a group of younger kids singing "Que Sera Sera," adorably off-key. Lights up, lights down. The Benson twins nail their harmony on "Dream." Center spot, fade. A boy does yo-yo tricks that actually work this time. Stage left, stage right, blackout.

Betty's cabin performs their comedy sketch about counselors, and the whole camp erupts in laughter. I catch Betty's eye from my station and give her a thumbs up. She grins, taking her bow.

Sparky's magic act is charmingly disastrous—flowers that won't appear, cards that scatter everywhere. But he plays it for laughs and gets huge applause anyway.

Each act brings Jamie's performance closer.

I flip switches, follow cues, stay focused. But my heart is racing in a way that has nothing to do with technical precision.

When Michael announces "Jamie Sullivan performing an original spoken word piece," my hands actually shake.

Jamie walks onto the stage alone. No props, no tricks, no elaborate setup. Just him in his rolled jeans and white t-shirt, looking more nervous than I've ever seen him. He's holding a piece of paper, but after glancing at it once, he folds it and puts it in his pocket.

The mess hall goes completely quiet. Even the younger kids stop fidgeting.

He takes a breath. I can see his chest rise and fall from here. Then he speaks.

The poem is beautiful. His voice is steady despite the nerves I can see in his shoulders, in the way he grips his hands together. He talks about being invisible by being loud, about wearing masks and playing the clown because it's safer than being seen. About hiding behind chaos and pranks and not caring.

Then he talks about someone who looked past all of that. Someone who saw the real person underneath and didn't turn away.

He talks about books and quiet corners and unexpected conversations. About someone who made him want to create instead of destroy. About finding connection in the last place he expected.

Every word is about me. About us.

The audience is completely silent, hanging on every word. But I barely hear the last few lines because my vision is blurring and my throat is tight and I understand—really understand—what this means.

He made this for me. Spent all summer working up the courage to stand on a stage and bare his soul in front of everyone, just to show me what I meant to him.

When he finishes, there's a beat of silence. Then the applause erupts, loud and genuine. Campers are actually moved. Some of the girls are wiping their eyes.

Jamie's face flushes as he takes a quick bow and escapes off stage. His eyes find mine across the room for just a second, vulnerable and questioning.

I can't breathe. My hands are shaking so hard I'm afraid I'll miss my next cue.

The show continues. More acts, more applause, more switches to flip. I go through the motions on autopilot, but my mind is spinning.

Jamie wrote that poem. For me. About me. He stood up there in front of everyone and made his feelings undeniably clear.

And I've been falling for him too, but I didn't have the courage to say it out loud until yesterday on the dock.

The final act finishes—a group sing-along to "Good Night, Sweetheart." I bring up all the lights for the finale. The audience applauds and whoops.

Michael hops onto the stage, his director's smile bright and proud.

"Thank you all for an amazing show!" he says into the microphone. "Every single performer brought something special tonight. I'm so proud of everyone."

The camp applauds again. I'm already starting to relax, thinking about how I need to find Jamie, need to tell him how perfect his poem was.

"Before we end the night, I have to give some special thanks," Michael continues. "First, to our incredible lighting technician, Lily Palmer, who made sure every performance looked perfect."

People turn to look at me, applauding. I wave awkwardly from my station, embarrassed by the attention.

"And of course, to the real star of this production—the person who designed every set piece, painted every backdrop, and kept me sane through three weeks of chaos." Michael extends his hand toward the side of the stage. "Dorothy Hayes, come up here."

Dorothy climbs onto the stage, laughing and shaking her head like she doesn't want the attention. But Michael pulls her to his side, and even from my lighting board I can see the warmth between them.

"I couldn't have done any of this without my wonderful girlfriend," Michael says, his arm around Dorothy's shoulders.

The words hit like cold water.

Girlfriend. He said girlfriend. In front of everyone.

The camp applauds enthusiastically, clearly not surprised by this revelation at all. People are smiling, some whistling approval. Dorothy blushes but leans into Michael's side, comfortable and happy.

They look perfect together. Obviously a couple. Obviously in love.

And everyone knew. Everyone except me.

I watch Michael kiss Dorothy's temple, watch them laugh at something someone shouts from the audience. Watch them be exactly what I pretended they weren't for an entire summer.

My face burns with humiliation. How many people noticed me volunteering for everything Michael ran? How many people saw me watching him like a lovesick puppy, timing my activities around his schedule, finding excuses to be near him? How many people whispered about it, or worse—felt sorry for the quiet girl with the obvious, hopeless crush?

Everyone knew about Michael and Dorothy. Betty knew and tried to hint. Dorothy knew and was nothing but kind about it. Probably even Michael knew I had a crush on him, and he was just too professional and decent to embarrass me by acknowledging it directly.

I was the only person at Camp Silver Lake living in a complete fantasy.

The realization makes me want to sink through the floor.

My vision blurs. The applause continues around me, but it sounds distant and muffled. I need to get out of here. Right now.

Michael is thanking more people—counselors, Mrs. Morrison, the kitchen staff. His voice fades as I stumble away from the lighting board.

Betty calls my name from somewhere in the crowd, but I can't stop. Can't turn around. Can't face anyone seeing my humiliation.

I push through the mess hall door into the cool night air and start running.

I don't know where I'm going at first. My feet carry me automatically away from the lights and noise and all those people who knew the truth I refused to see.

The lake. I'm heading to the lake.

The dock is dark and empty, the water black under the stars. I run to the very end and collapse onto the worn wood, pulling my knees to my chest.

And then I cry.

Not delicate tears. Ugly, gasping sobs that I've been holding back all summer. I cry for the weeks I wasted chasing someone who was never going to see me. I cry for the humiliation of everyone knowing what I refused to accept. I cry for being so desperate to feel safe that I chose a fantasy over reality.

But underneath the hurt and embarrassment, there's something else. A strange, unexpected relief.

Because I don't actually care about Michael Grant. I never did, not really. I was in love with an idea—the safe, unattainable boy who could never reject me because I never really tried. A fantasy I could control, where my heart stayed perfectly protected behind walls of books and impossible crushes.

I cry harder, understanding the truth with painful clarity. Michael was never going to hurt me because Michael was never real. He was just a shield I built against actually feeling something. Against being vulnerable enough to let someone see the real me and risk them walking away.

Against feeling what I feel for Jamie.

Jamie, who sees all of me and stays anyway. Jamie, who wrote me a poem and stories and spent a summer trying to show me I mattered. Jamie, who's terrifying because he's real and present and could actually break my heart.

I was so busy hiding behind my safe crush that I almost missed the person who was really there all along.

The tears finally slow, leaving me empty and raw and strangely lighter. Like something heavy has been cut away from my chest, and for the first time in months, I can finally breathe.

I hear footsteps on the dock behind me. Soft, careful, like whoever it is doesn't want to startle me.

I don't turn around. I already know who it is.

Jamie sits down beside me without a word, close enough that I can feel his warmth but not quite touching. He doesn't ask if I'm okay or try to make me talk.

He just sits there, steady and patient and exactly what I need.
