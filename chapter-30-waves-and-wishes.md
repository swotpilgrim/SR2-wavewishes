# Chapter 30: Waves and Wishes Come True

Morning comes too soon.

The rising bell rings for the last time, and the cabin erupts into controlled chaos. Everyone's packing final items, stripping beds, saying goodbyes. Parents will arrive at two o'clock, and we need to be ready.

I pack my trunk mechanically, folding clothes and tucking away books. At the bottom, I place Jamie's handbound book of stories, wrapped carefully in a sweater to keep it safe. The most precious thing I'm taking home.

Betty sits on my stripped bunk. "You going to be okay?"

"I don't know. Ask me in a few weeks when I know if we're going to make it."

"You'll make it. I've never seen two people more meant for each other."

"Even though we're young and dramatic and facing impossible logistics?"

"Especially because of that. The best loves are the ones you fight for."

I hug her tight. "I'm going to miss you."

"I'll miss you too. But you better write me. I want all the Jamie updates."

"Every single one."

After breakfast, I find Jamie at our spot by the rocks, sketchbook in hand.

"Drawing?"

He looks up and smiles. "Trying to capture this place. So I can remember it exactly."

I sit beside him. His sketch captures the feeling of this space, not just the look of it.

"That's amazing."

"I've had good inspiration all summer." He closes the sketchbook. "How are you feeling?"

"Scared. Sad. Hopeful. All of it at once."

"Yeah. Same." He takes my hand. "I talked to my dad this morning. Military school is still on the table. He wants a final decision by September."

"Jamie, I'm so sorry."

"It's okay. I expected it." He squeezes my hand. "But even if they send me away, I'm still glad this summer happened. You happened. And I'll figure out how to keep you in my life no matter where they put me."

"Promise?"

"Promise. You're not getting rid of me, Lily Palmer."

We sit together in silence, memorizing this spot. The rocks where we first really talked. The place that became ours over eight weeks of summer.

"I should give you something," Jamie says suddenly. "A proper goodbye gift."

"You already gave me the book. That's more than enough."

"That was my confession. This is different." He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a folded piece of paper. "I wrote you something last night. After the bonfire, after our talk. I couldn't sleep, so I wrote."

I unfold the paper carefully. It's covered in his handwriting—a letter.

*Lily—*

*You came into my life like a storm I didn't see coming. One minute I was going through motions, causing trouble. The next, there was this girl yelling at me about a wet book, and suddenly I couldn't stop caring.*

*You made me want to be better. Not because adults told me to, but because you were worth being better for. You deserved someone real.*

*That's the real gift of this summer—not just falling in love with you, though I did that completely. The real gift is learning that I can be loved. The real me, damage and all, is worth someone's heart.*

*I don't know what happens next. Real life is complicated. But I know this summer mattered. And I'm going to fight to keep us, no matter how hard it gets.*

*Thank you for seeing me. Thank you for choosing reality over fantasy.*

*I love you. I'll love you through whatever comes because that's what you do when someone changes your life.*

*Yours, Jamie*

I'm crying by the time I finish reading.

"Jamie—"

"You don't have to say anything. I just wanted you to have it. Something to keep."

"It is real." I fold the letter carefully. "It's the most real thing that's ever happened to me."

He pulls me close, and we sit there holding each other until the lunch bell rings. Our last meal at Camp Silver Lake.

The mess hall is subdued. Michael and Dorothy sit together, his arm around her. They catch my eye and wave. I wave back, genuinely happy for them.

Betty makes us take a group photo. We crowd together, arms linked, smiling through tears.

After lunch comes final packing. Parents start arriving early. The camp fills with station wagons and sedans, mothers crying, fathers shaking hands with counselors.

My parents arrive at exactly two o'clock, punctual as always and completely separate. Different cars, staying ten feet apart. Mom looks tired. Dad looks annoyed.

But that's okay. I'm not the same girl they dropped off eight weeks ago.

"Did you have a good summer?" Mom asks, scanning for my trunk.

"The best summer," I say.

She barely hears me. Dad's already loading my trunk into his car.

They're going to leave soon, and I haven't said goodbye to Jamie yet.

"I need five minutes," I tell my mother. "To say goodbye to someone."

"Lily, we need to get on the road—"

"Five minutes. Please."

Something in my voice must convey urgency because she nods. "Five minutes. Meet us at the car."

I run toward the boys' cabins, scanning for Jamie. He's standing by a beat-up sedan with a man who must be his father—they have the same dark hair and sharp features, but where Jamie's eyes are warm, his father's are cold.

"Dad, just give me a second," Jamie's saying.

"We're already late. Your mother is expecting us by dinner."

"Please. Two minutes."

Jamie spots me and his face transforms. He jogs over, leaving his father scowling by the car.

"You're leaving," he says.

"My parents are waiting. You?"

"Same. Dad's in a hurry to get rid of me."

We don't have time for long goodbyes. Parents are watching. Cars are leaving. Summer is officially over.

Jamie cups my face in both hands. "I love you. Remember that when it's hard and you're doubting everything. I love you, and this was real."

"I love you too. Write me."

"Every week. I promise."

"Call when you can."

"Every chance I get."

He kisses me, quick and desperate and full of promises. His father honks the horn, impatient. My mother is probably tapping her foot by now.

"I have to go," I whisper.

"Me too."

But neither of us moves. This is it—the real goodbye. The moment summer ends and reality begins.

"Thank you," I say. "For everything. For seeing me. For making me brave. For loving me."

"Thank you for the same." He kisses me once more, soft and sweet. "This isn't goodbye forever. It's just goodbye for now."

"Goodbye for now," I repeat.

He lets me go, and I force myself to walk away. To not look back. To keep moving even though every instinct screams to run back to him.

My parents are waiting by the car, both looking impatient.

"Ready?" Dad asks.

I look back one more time. Jamie's standing by his father's car, watching me. When our eyes meet, he holds up his hand. Not waving goodbye. Just... acknowledging. Promising. Remembering.

I hold up mine in return.

Then I get in the car, and we drive away from Camp Silver Lake.

As we pull onto the main road, I turn to look back. The camp is getting smaller, disappearing behind trees.

The summer I came to Camp Silver Lake, I was hiding from life. Choosing fantasy over reality.

But Jamie taught me that being seen is better than being invisible. That real love is worth every risk.

My mother is already arguing with my father via radio about whose weekend I'll spend first.

But I'm not the same girl who left them eight weeks ago. I learned about bravery and connection. I don't have to be invisible at home.

In my pocket, I feel the folded letter from Jamie. In my trunk is his handbound book of stories. In my heart is the memory of everything we shared.

This isn't an ending. It's a beginning.

The beginning of figuring out how to be brave in real life. How to maintain connection across distance.

The beginning of letters written late at night. Phone calls stolen when parents aren't listening. Visits planned and counted down to.

The beginning of proving that love found in summer doesn't have to fade with the season.

I pull out Jamie's letter and read it again. *You made me want to be better. You made me realize I can be loved.*

He did the same for me. Made me believe I was worth seeing. Worth loving.

As the car carries me home, toward complicated family dynamics and all the challenges of making a long-distance relationship work at sixteen, I'm not scared.

I'm ready. Ready to fight for this. Ready to be brave. Ready to choose reality over fantasy every single day.

Because I have Jamie Sullivan's letter in my pocket and his book of stories in my trunk and his words in my heart.

And I have my own story now—not a fantasy I read in books, but a real story about real love and real bravery and real connection.

The waves lap at the shore behind us, carrying wishes out to sea.

And somehow, impossibly—my wishes came true.

Not the fantasy wishes I had when I arrived. Those were meant to keep me safe by keeping me alone.

But the real wishes. The ones I didn't even know I had until Jamie showed me.

The wish to be seen. The wish to be brave. The wish to love and be loved in return.

Those wishes came true.

And that's worth every scary, uncertain, wonderful thing that comes next.

*THE END*
