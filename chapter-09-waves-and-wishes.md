# Chapter 9: Moonlight Confessions

I can't sleep.

It's past lights-out, maybe eleven o'clock, and the cabin is full of soft breathing and the occasional creak of bunk beds. Betty sleeps peacefully below me, and the other girls are equally quiet. But my mind won't stop spinning—replaying the scavenger hunt, Jamie's laugh, the way he said "we make a pretty good team" like it was a revelation.

Finally, I give up. I climb down from my bunk carefully, avoiding the squeaky spot on the third rung. My flashlight is under my pillow, and I grab it along with a sweatshirt. The cabin door protests slightly when I open it, but no one stirs.

The camp is different at night. Quiet and shadowy, with moonlight turning everything silver. I can hear the lake lapping against the shore, crickets singing in the grass, and nothing else. Everyone else is asleep, leaving the whole world to me.

I head toward the dock without consciously deciding to. It's become my refuge, the place I go when I need to think. Tonight, I need to think about a lot.

About how I barely thought about Michael all day. About how Jamie made me laugh until my sides hurt. About the uncomfortable possibility that the boy I thought was ruining my summer might actually be making it bearable.

The dock stretches out into darkness, the water beyond it reflecting stars. I sit at the end, dangling my legs over the edge, and let out a breath I didn't know I was holding.

"Couldn't sleep either?"

I don't even jump. Of course Jamie is here.

He emerges from the shadows near the shore, hands in his pockets, looking as unsurprised to see me as I am to see him.

"Do you have radar for wherever I am?" I ask.

"Maybe." He walks out onto the dock and sits beside me, not asking permission, just settling in like this is exactly where he belongs. "Or maybe I was here first and you followed me."

"Were you?"

"Nope. But it's a nice thought."

Despite myself, I smile. We sit in silence for a moment, watching the moonlight shimmer on the water. It's peaceful in a way that feels different from reading alone—less lonely, more complete.

"So," Jamie says eventually, "what's keeping book girl awake? Let me guess—analyzing the deeper meaning of today's scavenger hunt victory?"

"Something like that."

"And what's your analysis?"

I consider lying, deflecting, keeping my walls up. But there's something about the darkness and the quiet and the way Jamie is just sitting here, not pushing, just present, that makes me want to tell the truth.

"I'm trying to figure out when you stopped being annoying and started being...not that."

He laughs, soft and genuine. "That's the nicest thing you've ever said to me."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late. Way too late." He picks up a small stone from the dock and tosses it into the water, watching the ripples spread. "For what it's worth, you stopped being the defensive girl who hates me somewhere around the time you didn't run away from our rock spot."

"I wanted to run away."

"But you didn't. That counts."

We fall into comfortable silence again. The stars overhead are incredible, more than I've ever seen in my suburban neighborhood back home. The Milky Way stretches across the sky like spilled paint.

"Can I ask you something?" Jamie's voice is quieter now, more serious. "Back at the campfire, when I asked what you're hiding from. You said 'everything.' What did you mean?"

The question should feel intrusive, but it doesn't. Maybe because he shared his own truth that night, or maybe because I'm tired of carrying it alone.

"My parents," I say slowly. "They fight. Not the loud, screaming kind—the cold, quiet kind that never ends. Every conversation is a criticism. Every meal is silent or tense. They don't know how to be happy anymore, and I don't know if they ever did."

"That sucks."

"Yeah." I wrap my arms around my knees. "I learned pretty early that disappearing was easier than being in the middle of it. If I stayed quiet, stayed invisible, maybe they'd forget to be disappointed in each other and wouldn't start being disappointed in me too."

"That's not how it works though," Jamie says gently. "Their problems aren't about you."

"I know. In my head, I know that. But it still feels like if I could just be better, quieter, less of a burden, maybe things would improve."

"So you came to camp."

"They thought it would help me 'come out of my shell.'" I make air quotes around the phrase. "Like being forced into social situations with strangers would magically transform me into someone different."

"And instead you brought books and tried to stay invisible anyway."

"Can you blame me? Invisible is safe. Invisible means you can't be hurt."

Jamie is quiet for a long moment. Then: "Invisible also means you can't be seen. And being seen is how you know you matter."

The words hit harder than they should. I blink against sudden tears, grateful for the darkness hiding my face.

"What about you?" I ask, deflecting. "You said your parents are divorced. That you feel unwanted."

He tosses another stone, harder this time. "They split two years ago. Really messy, lots of lawyers, lots of blame. My dad moved out, got a new apartment, started dating someone six months later. My mom stayed in the house but started dating too. Now my dad has a whole new family—his girlfriend has two kids—and my mom is getting remarried to some guy who treats me like an inconvenience."

"Jamie, I'm so sorry."

"The worst part is they both think they're doing me favors. 'Quality time' with Dad is him taking his girlfriend's kids to baseball games and occasionally remembering I exist. 'Family dinners' with Mom is sitting at a table while she and her fiancé talk about their future and I'm very clearly not part of the picture." He runs a hand through his hair. "So yeah, camp is where they park me for the summer. Out of sight, out of mind, one less problem to juggle."

"You're not a problem."

"Try telling them that."

I understand now—the pranks, the chaos, the constant need for attention. If he's causing trouble, at least people are looking at him. At least he exists.

"Is that why you cause so much trouble? To be noticed?"

"Partly." He leans back on his hands, looking up at the stars. "Also because if I'm the troublemaker, I control the narrative. I'm not the rejected kid or the inconvenient son—I'm the guy who doesn't care, who does what he wants. It's armor, same as your books."

"We really aren't that different."

"Told you."

A fish jumps somewhere out in the dark water, making us both look. The ripples spread and fade, and I think about how we're like those ripples—trying to make an impact, to prove we exist, before disappearing back into darkness.

"So what do we do?" I ask. "Keep hiding? Keep pretending?"

"Or," Jamie says slowly, "we try something radical. We let ourselves be seen. We risk it."

"That's terrifying."

"Yeah." He looks at me, and in the moonlight his expression is open, vulnerable. "But maybe less terrifying if we do it together."

"Together?"

"You be a little less invisible. I be a little less chaotic. We both try being real instead of armored." He holds out his hand. "Deal?"

I look at his offered hand, then at his face. Jamie Sullivan, who ruined my book and crashed my swimming lesson and called me out on my fantasies and somehow became the first person to actually see me in longer than I can remember.

I take his hand. "Deal."

His grip is warm and firm, and we shake on it formally, like we're signing a treaty. When he lets go, my hand feels cold.

"So," he says, "being real. What does that look like for you?"

"I have no idea."

"Me neither. We'll figure it out as we go." He stands, brushing off his jeans. "But maybe we start with honesty. Like tonight—you told me real things, I told you real things. That's a start."

"Are we..." I hesitate. "Are we friends, Jamie?"

"I think we might be. Unless you still hate me for the book incident."

"I'm working on forgiving you."

"I'll take it." He offers me his hand again, this time to help me up. I take it, and he pulls me to my feet with easy strength. "Come on. Let's get you back before Mrs. Morrison does bed checks and we both get in trouble."

We walk back toward the cabins in companionable silence, the flashlight beam bouncing along the path. When we reach the fork where the boys' and girls' sections split, Jamie pauses.

"Hey, Lily?"

"Yeah?"

"Thanks. For listening. For not making it weird."

"Thanks for sharing. For making me feel less alone."

He grins, the moonlight catching in his eyes. "That's what friends do, right?"

"I guess so."

"See you tomorrow, book girl. Try not to overthink this."

"No promises."

He laughs and heads toward the boys' cabins, and I watch him go for a moment before slipping back into Pine Grove. Betty stirs when I climb into my bunk but doesn't wake fully. I lie there, staring at the ceiling, my mind still spinning.

But it's different now. I'm not thinking about Michael or fantasies or how to stay invisible. I'm thinking about Jamie's hand in mine, about shared truths under starlight, about how being seen by someone who understands might not be terrifying after all.

It might actually be the best part of this whole summer.

I fall asleep smiling, for the first time since arriving at Camp Silver Lake, genuinely looking forward to tomorrow.
