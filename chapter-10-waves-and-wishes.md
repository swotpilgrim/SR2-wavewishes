# Chapter 10: The First Real Connection

Morning arrives too early. I wake to Betty shaking my shoulder. I've slept through breakfast bell—fifteen minutes until swimming.

"You never oversleep," she says. "Late night?"

"Couldn't sleep. Went for a walk."

"A walk. Alone." She doesn't believe me but doesn't push. We throw on swimsuits and race to the waterfront, arriving breathless just as Michael starts.

I slide into the back of the group, trying to be invisible out of habit. Then I catch myself—didn't I promise Jamie I'd try being seen? But old patterns are hard to break, especially when exhaustion is making my thoughts fuzzy.

Michael runs through the day's lesson plan—diving technique and water safety. Then he asks for a volunteer to demonstrate.

"I need someone comfortable in the water who can show the group a basic dive. Any volunteers?"

My stomach clenches. Normally I'd duck my head, avoid eye contact, let someone else take the spotlight. But I think about last night, about Jamie saying being seen is how you know you matter, and before I can talk myself out of it, my hand starts to rise.

Then pure panic sets in. What am I doing? I can't dive well. I'm going to embarrass myself in front of everyone, in front of Michael, and—

"I'll do it!" Jamie's voice cuts through my spiral. He's appeared at the edge of the group, late as usual, grinning at Michael. "I'm an excellent diver. Well, excellent is subjective. I'm an enthusiastic diver."

Michael laughs. "Alright, Sullivan. Show us what you've got."

I watch as Jamie jogs to the end of the dock. He turns back, catches my eye, and winks. Then he proceeds to do the most spectacularly terrible belly-flop I've ever seen—arms windmilling, back flat, massive splash.

The whole class erupts in laughter. Even Michael is grinning.

"Okay, maybe not like that," Michael calls as Jamie surfaces, still grinning. "Let me show you the proper form."

As the lesson continues, I stand there processing what just happened. Jamie saw my panic. He saw me about to volunteer and recognized it for what it was—terror disguised as bravery. And he stepped in, making himself the center of attention so I didn't have to be.

He saved me while making it look like chaos. Typical Jamie.

After the lesson, I catch up to him on the path back to camp.

"You didn't have to do that."

"Do what? Demonstrate my natural diving talent?" He wrings water from his t-shirt. "I have no idea what you mean."

"Jamie."

He looks at me, something soft in his expression. "You looked terrified. I figured you'd rather watch me make an idiot of myself than accidentally make yourself uncomfortable. Friends help friends, right?"

"By belly-flopping?"

"It's an art form."

I shake my head, but I'm smiling. "Thank you."

"Anytime." He starts to walk away, then turns back. "Oh, and Lily? You had your hand halfway up. That counts. You tried. Next time will be easier."

He's gone before I can respond, leaving me standing there wondering when exactly Jamie Sullivan became the person who understands me best.

After lunch, I return to the cabin. A book waits on my pillow—*The Catcher in the Rye*. The one I'd mentioned to Jamie. A note is tucked inside:

*"Saw this in Mrs. Morrison's lending library. Thought you'd want to read it before everyone else tells you what to think about it. - J"*

He remembered. Not just that I wanted to read it, but that I'd want my own opinion first.

Such a small thing. Such a thoughtful thing.

I open to the first page.

---

By evening recreation time, I've made it through three chapters. Holden Caulfield is angry and judgmental and strangely compelling. I'm not sure I like him yet, but I understand him—that restless feeling of not belonging anywhere, of everyone around you being phony.

I take the book with me to the recreation hall, where campers are playing cards and board games. Betty is deep in a gin rummy tournament with some girls from Cabin Five. I find a quiet corner and settle in with my book.

I've read maybe two pages when someone plops down on the floor next to me.

Jamie, of course. He has a deck of cards and is laying out a solitaire game with intense concentration.

"Don't you have friends to play with?" I ask.

"Sparky's doing archery. And I prefer this corner."

"This is my corner."

"Our corner," he corrects, placing a red queen on a black king. "I thought we established this whole sharing thing."

"That was for the rock spot."

"The principle applies everywhere." He glances at my book. "How is it?"

"Strange. Angry. Interesting."

"That tracks. Holden's kind of exhausting but also kind of right about most things."

"You really did read it for English."

"I really did." He wins his solitaire game and starts shuffling for another. "Want to play something? I'll teach you gin rummy."

"I know how to play gin rummy."

"Then you should play. Reading in corners is very on-brand for you, but you're supposed to be trying new things, remember?"

He has a point. And maybe I want to play cards with Jamie Sullivan. Maybe that's exactly what I want to do.

"Fine. But I'm keeping score."

"Wouldn't expect anything less."

We play three games. I win the first, he wins the second, the third is so close we argue about the final score for five minutes before Betty intervenes and declares it a draw.

"You two are ridiculous," she announces, but she's smiling.

"She's a sore loser," Jamie says.

"He's a sore winner," I counter.

"You're both competitive and it's adorable." Betty grins. "I'm going to get snacks. Want anything?"

We both shake our heads, and she disappears toward the concession window. Jamie starts shuffling the cards again, but slower, more thoughtful.

"So," he says, "you're reading in corners and playing cards. That's progress."

"Is it?"

"You're here instead of hiding in your cabin. You're sitting with people instead of actively avoiding them. Yeah, that's progress." He deals out another hand. "How does it feel?"

"Weird. Uncomfortable. Less lonely."

"That's the less invisible thing. You get used to it."

"Do you?"

"I don't know yet. Still figuring it out." He picks up his cards, studying them. "But having someone else trying at the same time makes it easier."

We play in comfortable silence, and I realize something that makes my chest tighten: I haven't thought about Michael once today. Not during swimming, not during lunch, not since waking up. I've thought about Jamie—his belly-flop rescue, his book gift, his easy company—but not the golden-boy fantasy I've been nursing all week.

The realization should scare me, but it doesn't. It feels right, like something shifting into place.

"You're making a face," Jamie observes.

"What face?"

"Your thinking-too-hard face. What's wrong?"

"Nothing's wrong. Just...realizing something."

"Good realization or bad?"

"I'm not sure yet."

He nods, accepting that, and we keep playing. But I'm hyperaware of him now—the way he shuffles cards, the competitive glint in his eye when he wins a hand, the easy laugh when I beat him on the next. He's so present, so real, so completely different from the safe fantasy I'd been building around Michael.

Michael is kind and handsome and perfect from a distance. Jamie is complicated and honest and right here, seeing me fully and somehow still choosing to sit on the floor playing cards.

"Lily?" Betty's voice breaks my thoughts. She's returned with cookies. "You okay? You spaced out."

"I'm fine. Just tired."

"You should get some sleep," Jamie says, starting to gather the cards. "Big day tomorrow—more swimming, more activities, more opportunities for me to embarrass myself for your benefit."

"You don't have to do that."

"I know. But where's the fun in that?" He stands, offering me a hand up. I take it, and he pulls me to my feet easily. "See you tomorrow, book girl. Keep reading—it gets better."

He hands me my book and heads off toward the boys' section, leaving me with Betty and a head full of confusing thoughts.

Betty waits exactly five seconds. "Okay, what was that?"

"What was what?"

"That whole thing with Jamie. The cards, the book, the looking at each other when you think no one notices."

"We're just friends."

"Uh huh. And I'm the Queen of England." She links her arm through mine as we walk back to Pine Grove. "Lily, it's okay to like him."

"I don't—I mean, he's—we're just—" I can't finish the sentence.

"You're allowed to change your mind about Michael. You're allowed to notice when someone else sees you." Betty squeezes my arm. "And Jamie definitely sees you."

"It's complicated."

"Feelings usually are."

We walk in silence. Campfire smoke drifts through the air. Someone's playing a ukulele badly.

"I think I might be in trouble," I admit.

"Because you like Jamie?"

"Because I don't know how to like Jamie. He's so different from what I thought I wanted."

"Welcome to actually feeling things. It's terrifying and wonderful."

"How do you know I'll be fine?"

"Because Jamie looks at you like you matter. And you look at him like he's real. That's a good start."

I think about that as we reach our cabin. About being seen and being real and taking risks on things that could actually hurt because they actually matter.

Jamie matters.

When did that happen?

I climb into my bunk with *The Catcher in the Rye* and read until lights out, but Holden's voice keeps getting mixed up with Jamie's in my head. Both of them seeing through phoniness, both of them angry at the world in ways that make sense, both of them more vulnerable than they want anyone to know.

I fall asleep thinking about dock conversations and scavenger hunts and the way Jamie's hand felt in mine when we made our deal to be less invisible.

This summer was supposed to be about surviving. About counting down days and staying safe behind books and fantasies.

Instead, it's becoming about something real.

Someone real.

And that's terrifying and wonderful and completely unexpected.

Just like Jamie Sullivan himself.
