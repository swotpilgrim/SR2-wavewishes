# Chapter 2: The Golden Boy

The mess hall is packed wall-to-wall with girls, and the noise level makes my head pound. Long wooden tables stretch the length of the room, camp pennants hanging from the rafters. I slip into the very back row, clutching Jane Eyre like a shield. Around me, girls chatter and laugh, saving seats for cabin-mates. The energy is infectious and exhausting in equal measure.

Betty finds me anyway. "There you are! I saved you a seat up front with the rest of Cabin Seven."

"I'm fine here," I say, holding up my book. "Better lighting."

She looks skeptical but shrugs. "Suit yourself. But you're missing out—we have a great view up there."

A view of what, I almost ask, but she's already bouncing back to the front. I sink lower on the bench, grateful to be forgotten. The other girls in the back row are deep in their own conversations, leaving me blissfully invisible.

At precisely six o'clock, a woman in her fifties strides to the front. She's tall and sturdy, with iron-gray hair in a no-nonsense bun and the kind of presence that makes the room fall silent.

"Good evening, ladies. I'm Mrs. Patricia Morrison, and I've been running Camp Silver Lake for twenty years. Welcome. We have eight weeks together. Let's make them count."

Her voice is firm but not unkind. She launches into the rules—lights out at nine-thirty, no leaving cabins after curfew, no swimming without a counselor present, weekly letter-writing home on Sundays. I let the words wash over me while keeping my eyes on my book.

"Now," Mrs. Morrison says, her tone warming slightly, "let me introduce our counselor team. These young men and women are here to ensure your safety, guide your activities, and make this the best summer of your lives. When I call your name, please stand."

She starts with the senior counselors—Dorothy Hayes for arts and crafts, Susan Chen for nature studies, Robert Fletcher for archery. Each one stands and waves while the girls applaud politely. I barely glance up, more interested in Jane's arrival at Thornfield Hall.

Then Mrs. Morrison says, "And running our waterfront program, swimming, canoeing, and all aquatic activities—Michael Grant."

Something makes me look up.

He's standing at the side of the hall, and the late evening light from the windows catches him just right. Tall—maybe six feet—with broad shoulders and an athletic build that speaks of actual swimming expertise, not just summer job credentials. His hair is sandy brown, cut short and neat, and when he smiles at the room, it's the kind of smile that seems genuinely warm, not practiced. He wears the counselor uniform—white t-shirt, khaki shorts, whistle on a lanyard—but somehow makes it look better than everyone else.

The entire mess hall erupts in whispers and giggles. Even the girls in my back row sit up straighter.

"Oh my God, he's dreamy," someone sighs behind me.

"I heard he's a champion swimmer at University of Michigan," another girl adds. "He's going to be a senior."

"How old is that? Twenty? Twenty-one?"

"Who cares? Look at him."

I realize I'm staring and force my eyes back to my book, but the words blur on the page. My heart is doing something embarrassing in my chest—a fluttery, nervous thing that makes me feel stupid. I don't get crushes. Crushes are for girls like Betty, girls who know how to flirt and giggle and catch boys' attention. I'm the invisible girl, the one who reads in corners.

But Michael Grant... I risk another glance. He's still standing there, waving awkwardly like he's uncomfortable with the attention, which somehow makes him more appealing. There's nothing cocky about him, nothing that suggests he knows every girl in this room just developed a crush.

Mrs. Morrison continues introducing counselors, but I've stopped listening. My eyes keep drifting back to Michael, and I hate myself for it. This is exactly the kind of thing I don't do.

Except...

He's moving through the room, and he passes by a little girl—can't be more than twelve—struggling to pick up her orientation packet. Papers are scattered everywhere, and she looks close to tears. Michael crouches down and starts gathering the papers with her.

"No worries," I hear him say, his voice carrying that same easy warmth as his smile. "I drop things all the time. You should see me try to carry a stack of kickboards."

The little girl giggles, her anxiety visibly melting. Michael hands her the collected papers, taps the stack to even them out, and makes sure she's okay before standing and continuing to the counselor section.

My chest does that flutter thing again. Beautiful and kind. It's a devastating combination.

"He's something, isn't he?"

I jump. Betty has materialized beside me, sliding onto the bench with a knowing grin.

"I thought you were sitting up front," I manage.

"I was. But then I saw your face when Michael stood up, and I had to come back here." Her grin widens. "You like him."

"I don't even know him."

"That's not a no." Betty nudges my shoulder. "It's okay, Lily. Every girl here likes him. He's completely dreamy. But..."

"But what?"

"He's twenty. A college junior going into senior year. We're sixteen." She says it gently, not mean, just realistic. "And he's a counselor. They have rules about that kind of thing."

I know she's right. Of course she's right. Michael Grant is completely unattainable.

But as Mrs. Morrison drones on about weekly activities, I find myself watching him. He sits with the other counselors, occasionally leaning over to whisper something to Dorothy Hayes that makes her laugh. He has nice hands. Swimmer's hands.

This is ridiculous. I came here planning to stay invisible. Developing a crush on a twenty-year-old counselor is setting myself up for the exact kind of hurt I was trying to avoid.

And yet.

There's something safe about it, I realize. Michael is unattainable. He'll never look at me as anything more than a camper, which means I can never actually be rejected. I can spend the summer admiring him from a distance, a nice distraction from loneliness, and then go home with my dignity intact. It's a fantasy, and fantasies can't hurt you.

The orientation finally ends, and Mrs. Morrison dismisses us to evening free time before lights out. Girls pour out of the mess hall in clusters, already making plans to explore or write letters home or practice for tomorrow's swimming assessment.

"Want to walk around the lake?" Betty asks. "Some of the girls are going to try to find the boys' camp across the water."

"No thanks. I think I'll just...explore on my own."

Betty looks like she wants to argue but nods. "Okay. Don't be late for lights out—Mrs. Morrison wasn't kidding about the rules."

I slip away before she can insist I be social. The evening air is cooler than the stuffy mess hall. The scent of pine and lake water fills my lungs. The sun is setting, painting the sky pink and orange.

I walk toward the water, away from the noise. Other girls head toward the camp store or their cabins. No one pays attention to me, which is exactly how I like it.

The path slopes down through the trees, and suddenly I'm at the water's edge. A wooden dock stretches out into the lake, maybe thirty feet long, with a diving platform at the end. The water is calm, mirror-smooth, reflecting the sunset and the pine trees that ring the shore. It's the most peaceful thing I've seen since we arrived.

I walk out onto the dock, my saddle shoes making soft sounds on the weathered wood. At the end, I sit cross-legged and pull Jane Eyre from where I've been carrying it. The dock is deserted—everyone else is busy being social—and for the first time all day, I can breathe properly.

I open my book and sink into the familiar words. Jane is meeting Mr. Rochester for the first time. I've read this scene a dozen times, but it never gets old. There's something comforting about knowing how it ends.

Real life isn't like that. Real life is my parents' cold silences. Real life is being the girl nobody notices. Books are better.

But even as I read, my mind wanders to sandy brown hair and a warm smile, to strong hands helping a little girl pick up papers. I let myself imagine what it would be like if Michael Grant noticed me. Really noticed me.

It's a fantasy, I remind myself. Safe because it will never happen.

I open my eyes and focus on the lake. The sunset has deepened to purple and gold, and the first stars are appearing overhead. The water laps gently against the dock pilings, a rhythmic sound that matches my breathing. Somewhere in the distance, I hear laughter and a record player spinning out a Buddy Holly song.

This spot, at least, makes camp bearable. If I can find moments like this—quiet, alone, lost in my books with beauty around me—maybe I can survive eight weeks. Maybe I can even enjoy parts of it, in my own way.

I don't need friends or crushes or summer romance. I have my books, and now I have this dock, and that's enough.

It has to be enough.

The dinner bell rings from up the hill, calling us to the evening meal. I mark my place in Jane Eyre and stand, taking one last look at the darkening lake. Tomorrow the real camp schedule starts—activities and swimming lessons and forced social interaction.

But for now, for tonight, I have this moment of peace.

I walk back up the path toward the lights and noise, already counting the hours until I can escape back here tomorrow.
