# Chapter 23: Jamie's Steady Presence

Jamie doesn't ask if I'm okay.

He doesn't try to make me talk or tell me everything will be fine or offer any of the empty reassurances people usually give when they find someone crying.

He just sits beside me in the dark, close enough that our shoulders almost touch, and waits.

The silence should be awkward. I'm a mess—eyes swollen, nose running, face probably blotchy and red. I ran out of the talent show like a child and he followed me here. He should be asking questions, demanding explanations, maybe even saying "I told you so" about Michael.

But he doesn't do any of that.

He just sits. Patient and steady and letting me have whatever space I need.

I don't know how long we stay like that. Long enough for my breathing to even out, for the last hiccups to fade, for the mess hall behind us to go quiet as people head to their cabins. Long enough for the stars overhead to shift position slightly, for a cool breeze to come off the lake.

Finally, I wipe at my face one more time and speak, my voice rough and small.

"I'm sorry I ran out."

"Don't be." His voice is gentle in the darkness. "Heartbreak doesn't follow a schedule."

The understanding in those words almost makes me start crying again. He's giving me permission to fall apart, to not have it together, to be messy and human.

"I feel stupid," I admit.

"You're not stupid."

"Everyone knew about Michael and Dorothy. Everyone except me." The humiliation washes over me fresh. "I spent the whole summer chasing someone who was obviously taken, and everyone was probably laughing at me."

"Nobody was laughing at you, Lily." Jamie shifts slightly, turning more toward me. "And you weren't stupid. You were protecting yourself."

"Protecting myself from what?"

"From this." He gestures between us, at the space that feels charged and significant. "From real connection. From someone who might actually see you."

His words land with uncomfortable accuracy.

"Michael was safe," Jamie continues. "He was unattainable, which meant you couldn't get hurt. You could have your fantasy and keep your heart perfectly protected."

"You've thought about this a lot."

"I've had all summer to think about it." There's something wry in his voice. "Watching you chase someone who was never going to notice you while I was right here hoping you'd look my way just once."

Guilt stabs through me. "Jamie—"

"I'm not trying to make you feel bad. I'm just saying I understand why you did it. It's the same reason I cause trouble instead of letting people see the real me. We both hide, just in different ways."

We sit with that truth for a moment. The lake laps gently at the dock posts. Somewhere in the woods, an owl calls.

"Your poem was beautiful," I say quietly.

He goes very still beside me. "You really think so?"

"It was perfect. Brave and honest and..." I struggle to find words. "I can't believe you wrote that. That you stood up there and performed it for everyone to hear."

"I've been working on it all summer." His voice is soft. "I must have written fifty versions. None of them felt right until I stopped trying to be clever and just... wrote the truth."

"The truth about what?"

"About you. About how you inspired me to actually create something instead of destroy things. About how you made me want to be seen—really seen—for the first time in years."

My chest tightens. "Why me?"

"Because you saw me first." He picks up a loose stone from the dock and turns it over in his hands. "That day at the lake when I soaked your book. You got mad at me. Really mad. Most people just laugh at my pranks or tell me to grow up. But you looked at me like I was a real person doing a real shitty thing, not just the troublemaker performing his expected role."

"You ruined Jane Eyre."

"I know. And you called me on it. Treated me like someone capable of better instead of just another camp clown." He sets the stone down carefully. "That mattered. You mattered."

I don't know what to say to that. My throat is tight again, but not from sadness this time.

"I'm sorry I made you watch me chase Michael all summer," I finally manage. "That must have been awful."

"It was educational." He's trying for humor, but I can hear the hurt underneath. "I learned patience. And that watching someone hide from real feelings while chasing a fantasy can be pretty painful when you're on the outside."

"I wasn't hiding from you specifically—"

"I know. You were hiding from yourself." He turns to look at me, and even in the dim light I can see his expression. "That's what made it so frustrating. I could see you, Lily. The real you. The smart, observant, funny person under all that quiet. But you were so determined to stay invisible that you couldn't see yourself."

"Or you," I whisper.

"Or me." He nods. "But I get it now. I was risky. I paid attention and asked questions and wouldn't let you hide. That's terrifying when you've built your whole identity around not being seen."

He understands. He really, truly understands.

"I'm done hiding," I hear myself say.

"Yeah?"

"Yeah." I take a shaky breath. "I'm tired of wasting my life on safe fantasies. I'm tired of being so afraid of getting hurt that I never let myself feel anything real."

"Real can hurt," Jamie says quietly. "That's kind of the point. If it doesn't have the power to hurt you, it doesn't have the power to matter either."

"Did you write that in one of your stories?"

"Maybe." I can hear the smile in his voice. "Or maybe I just learned it this summer. From this girl who made me realize that hiding behind pranks and not caring was just another kind of fantasy."

We're talking around something. Dancing near the edges of what we both need to say but are too scared to speak directly.

"The poem," I start, then stop. "Was it... I mean, did you..."

"It was about you," he confirms. "The whole thing. Every word. I made it for you because I wanted you to know that someone sees you. Really sees you. And thinks you're worth writing poems about."

Oh.

"I don't know what to say."

"You don't have to say anything." His hand finds mine in the dark, fingers threading through mine naturally. "I just needed you to know. Even if nothing comes of it. Even if we go home in a few days and never talk again. I needed you to know that you mattered to someone this summer. That you weren't invisible to me. Not even close."

Our hands fit together perfectly. His palm is warm against mine, his grip gentle but certain.

"I see you too," I tell him. "I've been seeing you, even when I was pretending not to. All those conversations, all those moments by the rocks or on this dock. I was paying attention, Jamie. I just didn't let myself admit what it meant."

"And now?"

"Now I'm done lying to myself." I squeeze his hand. "I've been falling for you. Probably since you gave me that first book, or maybe before that. I just called it friendship because friendship felt safer than admitting I wanted more."

His breath catches. "Lily—"

"I'm terrified," I interrupt. "You're real and present and you know me, which means you could actually hurt me. But I'm more terrified of going home and never knowing what this could have been. Of spending the rest of my life hiding behind safe fantasies instead of taking one real risk."

For a long moment, Jamie doesn't respond. He just holds my hand, his thumb tracing small circles on my palm.

Then he speaks, his voice rough with emotion.

"I have something to show you. I was supposed to give it to you after my performance, but then everything happened and you ran, and..." He trails off. "Will you wait here? Just for a minute?"

"Okay."

He releases my hand and stands, and I immediately miss his warmth. He jogs back down the dock toward camp, leaving me alone with the stars and the water and the feeling that something significant is about to happen.

I wrap my arms around myself and wait, heart pounding, for whatever comes next.
