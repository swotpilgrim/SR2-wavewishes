# Chapter 22: Broken Wishes by the Water

I don't know how long I sit there before Jamie arrives, but it feels like forever and no time at all.

The dock is dark except for starlight reflecting off the black water. Behind me, the mess hall glows warm and yellow, music and voices drifting across camp. The talent show is still happening—or maybe it's over and people are celebrating. I can't tell from here, and I don't care.

I'm too busy crying.

Not the delicate, movie-heroine tears I always imagined for my first heartbreak. These are ugly, gasping sobs that shake my whole body. The kind where you can't catch your breath and your nose runs and you make embarrassing hiccup-ing sounds.

I cry into my knees, arms wrapped tight around myself like I can hold the pieces together through sheer force.

But here's the thing I'm realizing as tears soak into my skirt: these aren't really tears for Michael Grant.

Oh, I'm humiliated about Michael. Burning-face, want-to-disappear-forever humiliated. The image of him pulling Dorothy close, calling her his girlfriend in front of the entire camp—that will probably haunt me for years. Along with the terrible knowledge that everyone knew about them except me.

Betty knew. Dorothy knew. Probably every counselor and half the campers knew. They watched me volunteer for Michael's activities, saw me time my schedule around his, noticed me watching him like he hung the moon.

And they all knew it was pointless.

Some probably pitied me. Others probably laughed about the quiet girl's obvious crush. Maybe they made bets about how long it would take me to figure out the truth.

That thought makes me sob harder.

But underneath the humiliation and wounded pride, there's something deeper. Something that hurts worse because it's about me, not Michael.

I wasted my entire summer.

Eight weeks. Eight weeks I could have spent actually living, actually connecting with people, actually letting myself be seen. Instead, I hid behind a fantasy crush on someone who was never even a possibility.

Michael was safe precisely because he was impossible. I could pine for him without risk because he never knew I existed—not really. I could build elaborate daydreams about us without ever having to face the terrifying vulnerability of actually letting someone know me.

If he never saw me, he could never reject the real me.

The crying shifts, becomes something deeper. Because I'm not stupid—I understand what I've been doing now. Jamie tried to tell me, tried to show me, but I didn't want to see it.

I chose fantasy over reality. Safety over connection. Protection over possibility.

And I almost missed Jamie entirely.

Jamie, who's been right there since the second week of camp. Jamie, who saw me—really saw me—when I was trying so hard to be invisible. Jamie, who asked about my books and my thoughts and what scared me. Jamie, who told me about his parents and his pain and let me see past his troublemaker mask.

Jamie, who spent an entire summer creating things for me. Stories and poems and moments of genuine connection, all while I was busy staring at someone who barely knew my name.

I press my face harder against my knees, fresh tears starting.

Tonight, Jamie stood on a stage in front of everyone and recited a poem about me. About us. About being seen and finding unexpected connection in the last place you'd look. He made himself completely vulnerable, laid his feelings bare for the entire camp to witness. No jokes, no deflection, no troublemaker mask to hide behind.

Just Jamie, honest and terrified and sincere.

And I was so focused on my stupid fantasy that I barely processed how brave that was. How terrifying. How much courage it took for someone like Jamie—who hides behind pranks and chaos and carefully cultivated indifference—to stand still and honest and let everyone see his real heart.

He did that for me. And I'm only now understanding what that means.

And I've been so busy protecting myself from real feelings that I almost didn't notice.

The tears are slowing now, leaving me hollow and aching. The worst of the storm has passed, but I feel scraped raw, like all my defenses have been cried away.

I lift my head, wiping uselessly at my face. My eyes are probably swollen, my nose definitely red. I must look awful.

But maybe that's fitting. Maybe it's time to stop trying to look like I have everything together.

The lake is perfectly still, a black mirror reflecting stars. I can see the Big Dipper, Cassiopeia, Orion's belt. The same constellations that have been there all summer while I was too busy living in my head to actually look up.

Behind me, the camp sounds are quieting. The talent show must be over. People are probably heading back to cabins, laughing about favorite performances, reliving funny moments.

I wonder if anyone noticed me flee. I wonder if Betty came looking for me. I wonder if Jamie finished his poem, took his bow, and then watched me abandon my lighting board and run away like a scared child.

That thought makes shame crawl up my throat, hot and sour.

He put himself out there completely, and I ran away.

But no—that's not fair to myself. I ran away from Michael's announcement, from my own humiliation. Not from Jamie.

Except Jamie doesn't know that, does he? He stood on that stage, performed something vulnerable and beautiful meant for me, and then watched me run. For all he knows, I'm horrified by his confession. Embarrassed by his public declaration. Wishing he'd never said anything at all.

Oh God. What if he thinks I'm rejecting him?

I wipe at my face again, trying to pull myself together. I need to find him. Need to tell him that his poem was perfect, that I wasn't running from him, that I've been falling for him too and I'm just a disaster who didn't realize it until tonight.

But even as I think about standing up, about going back to camp and finding him, I stay frozen on the dock.

Because part of me is still terrified.

Michael was safe because he was impossible. But Jamie? Jamie is terrifyingly possible. He knows me—the real me, complete with all my insecurities and fears and tendency to hide in books. He's seen me cry and complain and be petty and difficult.

He knows exactly who I am.

Which means if he decides I'm not enough, it's not the fantasy version he's rejecting. It's the real me. The actual Lily Palmer who reads too much and talks too little and is afraid of her own shadow half the time.

That's the risk Michael never posed. You can't be rejected by someone who doesn't know you exist.

But Jamie knows I exist. He's paid attention to every word I've said, remembered details about my life, created stories about us. He sees me completely.

And that's absolutely terrifying.

What if I let myself fall for him—really fall, not just fantasize but actually open my heart—and he realizes I'm not worth it? What if the reality of being with me, of dealing with my fears and walls and desperate need to feel safe, is too much?

What if he gets tired of me the way my parents are tired of each other? What if I'm just as disappointing in reality as my mother finds my father, or as difficult as my father finds my mother?

The thought makes my stomach clench, makes me want to curl up tighter and never let anyone close again. But beneath the fear, there's something else. Something that feels like the truth I've been avoiding all summer, hiding from behind my safe Michael fantasy.

Jamie won't get tired of me.

I don't know how I know that, but I do. It's in every conversation we've had, every moment he's chosen to sit beside me instead of anywhere else. It's in the book of stories Dorothy mentioned, in the poem he just recited, in the way he looks at me like I matter.

He sees me—the real, complicated, imperfect me—and he's still here.

That's what I've been so afraid of, isn't it? Not rejection, but acceptance. Because if someone sees all of you and still chooses you, then you can't hide anymore. You have to be brave enough to show up as yourself, flaws and fears and all.

You have to risk getting hurt.

I take a shaky breath, wiping the last of the tears away.

The fantasy of Michael was safe because it was never real. But Jamie is real. This fear in my chest is real. The possibility of actually being happy with someone who knows me—that's real too.

I'm tired of hiding.

I'm tired of being so afraid of pain that I never let myself feel anything good either. So afraid of rejection that I reject myself first.

I'm tired of wasting my life on safe fantasies when real connection has been sitting right beside me all summer, patient and present and waiting for me to be brave enough to see it. To choose it.

A sound behind me—soft footsteps on the dock.

I know without turning around who it is.

Jamie doesn't say anything. He just sits down beside me, close enough that I can feel his warmth but not quite touching. Giving me space while making sure I'm not alone.

I don't look at him. Can't yet. But I'm intensely aware of his presence—solid and steady and exactly what I need.

We sit in silence while the stars wheel overhead and the lake laps gently against the dock posts. And despite everything, despite the tears and humiliation and fear, I feel something inside my chest start to unclench.

Because he's here. He came after me.

And that matters more than any fantasy ever could.
