# Chapter 4: Swimming in Dangerous Waters

The activity sign-up board is mobbed after breakfast. Betty grabs my arm and pulls me forward.

"Beginning swimming is filling up fast!"

"I can swim," I protest, but she's already writing my name.

"That's not the point. Michael teaches beginning." She winks, and my face flushes.

Is it that obvious?

"Relax. Half the girls here signed up even though they could swim before they could walk." Betty hands me the pencil. "Sign up for whatever else you want. I'm doing arts and crafts."

My stomach does a nervous flip. I'll be in the water with Michael. He'll be watching me, teaching me, maybe touching my arm to adjust my stroke.

I add my name to arts and crafts too, then walk away before I can overthink it.

---

At 9:45, I'm standing at the edge of the lake in my blue swimsuit, arms wrapped around myself. About fifteen other girls cluster nearby. Betty chatters beside me, but I'm not listening.

Michael emerges from the equipment shed carrying kickboards, and my heart stutters. In swim trunks and a white t-shirt, he's somehow even more attractive than at orientation.

What am I thinking? Why did I sign up for this?

"Morning, everyone!" Michael sets down the kickboards. "Welcome to beginning swimming. I'm Michael Grant. How many of you can already swim?"

Almost every hand goes up, including mine. Michael laughs, good-natured about it.

"Right. So we're calling this 'beginning swimming' but really it's 'improve your swimming and hang out at the lake for an hour.' I'm fine with that if you are." More laughter. He's so easy with people, so natural. "Let's start with some warm-ups. Everyone in the water—it's cold, I know, you'll adjust."

The lake is freezing. I wade in reluctantly until I'm waist-deep. Around me, other girls shriek and complain.

"Swim out to the floating rope and back," Michael calls.

I wait until several others have gone, then push off in a basic freestyle. I'm not fast, but I'm competent. When I wade out, Michael checks my name off.

"Nice form, Lily. You're comfortable in the water. That's the most important thing."

He said my name. He knows my name. My face flushes, and I manage a nod, not trusting my voice.

"Thanks," I whisper.

Then he's already looking at the next girl, and the moment passes. But he knew my name. That has to mean something, right?

---

For the next forty minutes, Michael guides us through stroke improvements. He demonstrates proper freestyle, his body cutting through the water with ease. He's patient when people struggle, encouraging when they succeed.

"Lily, can you help me demonstrate?" he calls, and I nearly drown from shock.

"Me?"

"Yeah, come here. I need someone to show the proper arm position."

I wade over on shaking legs. He's standing in shoulder-deep water, and up close he's even more attractive—droplets of water on his tan shoulders, eyelashes wet and dark, that easy smile focused on me.

"Hold your arm out like you're mid-stroke," he instructs.

I do, trying to remember what a proper stroke even looks like. Michael adjusts my elbow, his hand warm on my cold skin, positioning my arm at the right angle.

"See, everyone? Elbow high, hand entering the water thumb-first. Lily's got good instincts."

I can barely breathe. His hand is still on my arm, and I'm aware of every point of contact, every second he's touching me. Then he lets go and moves on to demonstrate the next part, and I float there dazed, my arm still extended stupidly.

Betty swims over, grinning. "You're blushing."

"Shut up."

"He picked you to demonstrate. That's a good sign."

"It doesn't mean anything."

"Keep telling yourself that."

The lesson ends too soon. As we wade back to shore, I steal one last look at Michael helping a younger girl with her kickboard. Patient and kind.

Beautiful and kind. It's not fair.

---

After lunch, I head to arts and crafts. Dorothy Hayes organizes supplies at the front—lanyard materials, leather-working tools, paint. She's pretty in an effortless way, with wavy brown hair and an easy smile. Around twenty, like Michael.

I take a seat at a back table. Betty joins me, planning an elaborate lanyard.

I pick up plastic strings without enthusiasm, thinking about Michael's hand on my arm, the way he said my name.

"Lily, right?" Dorothy appears at our table, warm and friendly. "First time at Camp Silver Lake?"

"Yes, ma'am."

She laughs. "No ma'am needed. I'm Dorothy. Just a counselor, not a teacher. Are you settling in okay?"

"Yes, thank you."

"Let me know if you need help with anything. The lanyard patterns can get tricky." She moves to the next table, and I watch her go.

Through the open pavilion, I can see the path to the waterfront. Michael walks by carrying a stack of life jackets, and Dorothy glances up, catching his eye. He grins and waves. She waves back, and there's something in that exchange—a familiarity, a warmth—that makes my stomach sink.

They know each other. Of course they do. They're counselors together.

"Earth to Lily." Betty waves a hand in front of my face. "You're staring."

"Sorry. Just...thinking."

"About a certain swimming instructor?"

I don't answer, but my silence is answer enough. Betty sighs, not unkindly.

"He's really nice, isn't he? But Lily, he's—"

"I know. He's too old. You said."

"That's not what I was going to say. I mean, he is, but also...just be careful, okay? Don't get your hopes up too much."

I focus on my lanyard, weaving the plastic strings in an over-under pattern. "I'm not hoping for anything."

It's a lie, and we both know it.

---

The afternoon drags. I work on my lanyard, half-listening to Dorothy's instructions, while my mind replays every second of the swimming lesson. Michael's hand on my arm. His smile. The way he knew my name.

I'm being ridiculous. He knows everyone's names—that's his job. And touching students to correct their form is normal for a swimming instructor. It doesn't mean anything.

But what if it could?

I'm so lost in thought that I don't notice someone sitting across from me until he speaks.

"Wow. That's a sad-looking lanyard."

I look up to find Jamie Sullivan straddling the bench across from me, grinning that infuriating grin. He's wearing the same white t-shirt from this morning, now dry, and his dark hair sticks up in about five different directions.

"What are you doing here?" I demand.

"Arts and crafts. It's a free activity." He picks up plastic strings and starts weaving them together with surprising dexterity. "What, you own this pavilion too? Along with the dock?"

"I thought boys had their own activities."

"We do. But this is open to everyone during free period. Equal opportunity lanyard-making." He grins wider, clearly enjoying my annoyance. "Still mad about your book?"

"Yes."

"Harsh. I said I was sorry."

"You said you were sorry and then made fun of me for being upset."

"I didn't make fun of you. I said you were feisty. That's a compliment."

Betty is watching this exchange with undisguised interest, glancing between us like she's watching a tennis match.

"You're in my space," I tell Jamie.

"It's a big table. Plenty of space for both of us." He focuses on his lanyard, weaving the pattern perfectly. Of course he's good at this. Is there anything that fazes him?

"Why are you here?" I ask again.

"Making a lanyard. Same as you. Why, do I need permission?" His eyes flick up, meeting mine, and there's a challenge in them.

"You should find somewhere else to sit."

"Should I? Why?"

"Because I was here first."

"Sounds familiar." He grins, and I realize he's referencing this morning at the dock.

I want to throw my lanyard at him. Instead, I focus on my weaving, ignoring him as pointedly as I can. Which is difficult when he's sitting right across from me, humming off-key and making his lanyard with infuriating ease.

"So," he says after a minute, "how was swimming? Looked like you were having fun."

My hands freeze. "Were you watching?"

"I was passing by. Couldn't help noticing the beginning swim class. Noticed you talking to Golden Boy."

"Golden Boy?"

"Michael Grant. Walking perfection. Every girl's dream." Jamie's tone is light, but there's an edge to it. "He seemed very attentive."

My face flushes. "He was teaching."

"Mmhmm. Teaching. Is that what we're calling it?"

Betty snorts, then tries to cover it with a cough.

I glare at Jamie. "Why do you care?"

"I don't. Just observing. You seemed pretty focused on him. Hope you're not holding your breath for anything."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

Jamie shrugs, still weaving. "Just that Golden Boy treats everyone like that. It's his thing. Super nice, super helpful, super equal opportunity with the friendliness. Don't mistake professional for personal."

The words sting because they might be true, but I refuse to let him see that.

"You don't know anything about it."

"I know more than you think." He ties off his lanyard—already finished, a perfect diamond pattern in blue and white—and holds it up. "There. Key chain for my mom, even though she probably won't use it. What's yours going to be?"

"None of your business."

"Wow, that's your answer to everything." He stands, pocketing his lanyard. "See you around, book girl. Try not to get your heart broken pining after someone who doesn't see you."

He walks away before I can respond, leaving me trembling with anger and something else I don't want to name.

Betty leans over. "Who was that?"

"Jamie Sullivan. The boy who ruined my book this morning."

"He's...intense."

"He's annoying."

"He also might have a point," Betty says gently.

I don't respond. I focus on my lanyard, weaving the strings together with shaking hands, trying not to think about Jamie's words or Michael's hand on my arm or the way Dorothy smiled when Michael walked by.

This is only the third day. Fifty-three more to go.

And already, camp feels infinitely more complicated than I'd planned.
