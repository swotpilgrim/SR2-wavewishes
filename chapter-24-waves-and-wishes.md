# Chapter 24: The Book of Stories

Jamie returns carrying something wrapped in cloth, cradling it carefully like it's precious.

He sits back down beside me, closer than before, and for a moment he just holds whatever it is. His hands are shaking slightly.

"This was supposed to be my actual talent show act," he says. "The poem was my backup plan. I spent all summer working on this, and when it came time to perform, I... I couldn't do it. Got scared. So I recited the poem instead, which felt safer somehow."

"What is it?"

Instead of answering, he unwraps the cloth. Moonlight catches on something dark—leather, I think. He places it in my hands.

It's a book. Small, roughly the size of a journal, with a leather cover that's been hand-tooled with a simple design. My fingers trace the pattern—waves and stars.

"Open it," Jamie says quietly.

I do, carefully. The pages inside are thick paper, not lined, and every single one is filled with Jamie's handwriting. But this isn't the messy scrawl he uses for school. This is careful, deliberate script, each word placed with intention.

And between the words are drawings. Small illustrations done in pen and ink, detailed and beautiful. I didn't even know Jamie could draw like this.

The first page is a title: *Stories of a Summer*.

Below that, in smaller letters: *For Lily*.

My throat goes tight.

I turn the page and start reading by starlight. The first story is titled "The Girl Who Lived in Books."

*There was once a girl who lived inside stories because the real world felt too dangerous. She had memorized every escape route between pages, knew exactly which characters would keep her safe. When people looked at her, she held up books like shields...*

The story continues, about a girl so good at disappearing she starts to fade, until someone sees her anyway. Someone who won't let her hide.

It's about me. About us.

My hands are shaking as I turn to the next story. "The Boy Who Caused Trouble."

*There was once a boy who learned that making people laugh or yell was better than making them care. He broke rules because at least then people noticed him, even if they didn't like what they saw...*

This story is about a boy who causes trouble until he meets someone who gets mad at him for real, who treats him like a person capable of better. Someone who makes him want to be more.

I keep reading. Each story is different—some funny, some tender, all of them about us in various forms. There's one about a scavenger hunt where two unlikely partners discover they work perfectly together. Another about late-night conversations under stars where two people share secrets they've never told anyone.

The illustrations bring each story to life. A girl with a book, her face hidden. A boy mid-cannonball, water frozen around him. Two figures sitting on a dock, close but not quite touching, surrounded by careful details of summer night.

He made all of this. Spent hours, weeks, creating this just for me.

"Jamie," I manage, my voice breaking. "This is..."

"Too much?" He sounds nervous. "I know it's intense. I kept telling myself to stop, that I was being weird and obsessive. But every time we talked, every time something happened between us, I wanted to capture it somehow. Make it permanent."

"It's beautiful." Tears are running down my face again, but different tears this time. "It's the most beautiful thing anyone's ever made for me."

He lets out a breath like he's been holding it all summer. "Yeah?"

"When did you start this?"

"After our first real conversation on the dock. The one where you told me about your parents fighting, and I told you about mine not wanting me." He leans closer so he can see the book too. "That night, I couldn't sleep. I kept thinking about how honest we'd been, how rare that was. So I started writing it down."

"And you just... kept going?"

"Every time we talked, something new appeared. The scavenger hunt gave me that story. Our fight and makeup gave me another one." He flips through pages. "See? They get better toward the end because I was learning to draw you better."

I look at the drawings more closely. He's captured tiny things—the way I tuck my hair behind my ear when nervous, how I hold books close to my chest. Details I didn't know anyone noticed.

"You've been paying attention," I whisper.

"I haven't been able to stop paying attention since week two." He turns more pages. "This one is from when you yelled at me about soaking Jane Austen. And this one is from the day we made up after our fight. I wrote it as soon as I got back to my cabin."

There are at least twenty stories in here. Maybe more. Each one its own small world where we find each other in different ways.

The last story is titled "Happy Ending Pending."

I look at Jamie, questioning.

"I didn't know how to end it," he admits. "Didn't know if you'd feel the same way, if this summer would mean anything beyond eight weeks at camp. So I left it unfinished. Open-ended."

"But you hoped?"

"God, yes. I hoped." His voice is raw. "Every day I hoped you'd stop looking at Michael and start seeing me. That you'd realize what was right in front of you. But I also knew I couldn't force it. You had to get there yourself, in your own time."

I flip back through the stories, seeing the summer through his eyes. All those moments I thought were just conversations or coincidences were actually him paying attention, remembering, creating art from our connection.

"Dorothy said you asked her questions about me," I say, remembering. "What kind of books I liked, what made me smile."

"I wanted to get the details right." He points to a drawing of me with a specific book. "That's your copy of The Secret Garden, not just any edition. See the bent corner on the back cover? I noticed that the day you were reading it at lunch."

The level of care, of attention, of genuine interest in who I am—it's overwhelming.

"Why didn't you show me this earlier?"

"Because it's terrifying." He laughs, but it sounds shaky. "This is every feeling I have laid out in black and white. If you'd seen it and said no, if you'd been weirded out or uncomfortable, I don't know if I could have come back from that."

"So you wrote a poem instead."

"The poem felt safer. I could be vulnerable without showing you this, without letting you see just how much I..." He stops, swallows. "Just how much you mean to me."

I close the book carefully and hold it against my chest, right over my heart.

"Jamie Sullivan, this is the most romantic thing anyone has ever done."

His laugh is surprised and relieved. "Really? Because I was worried it was creepy. Sparky said it was creepy."

"Sparky is an idiot. This is..." I struggle to find words big enough. "You made me permanent. You looked at our summer and decided it mattered enough to create art from it. To spend hours writing and drawing and binding a book by hand because our conversations were worth remembering."

"They were," he says simply. "You were. You are."

We're sitting so close now. His shoulder against mine, our faces just inches apart in the moonlight. I can see the vulnerability in his eyes, the fear that this might still somehow go wrong.

"Can I show you my favorite story?" he asks.

"Please."

He reaches over and carefully opens to a page near the end. "The Dock."

*There was once a dock where two people learned to be honest. They came alone at first, seeking quiet. But one night they found each other there, and instead of leaving, they stayed. They told each other true things about broken families and invisible girls and boys nobody wanted...*

The story continues, detailing conversations we've had right here. Private moments I thought were just between us, now immortalized in his handwriting.

The illustration shows the dock from above—two figures sitting close, surrounded by water and stars, a book between them.

"This is us," I whisper.

"This is us," he confirms. "Every story in here is us, just in different forms. Different versions of the same truth."

"What truth?"

He takes a breath. "That I've been falling for you since the moment you got mad about a wet book. That every conversation made it worse. That you inspired me to create instead of destroy for the first time in years. That this summer changed me because you changed me."

I set the book carefully aside and turn to face him fully.

"I have to tell you something," I say.

He looks nervous. "Okay."

"I've been an idiot."

"Lily—"

"No, listen. You spent all summer showing me in every possible way that I mattered to you. You paid attention and asked questions and made me art and wrote me poems. And I was so busy hiding behind a fantasy crush that I almost missed all of it."

"You were protecting yourself—"

"I was being a coward." I reach for his hand again. "But I'm done with that now. I'm done hiding behind safe fantasies and impossible crushes. I want reality. I want this."

"This?"

"You and me. This summer. Whatever comes after." I squeeze his hand. "I'm falling for you too, Jamie. I have been for weeks. I just didn't let myself admit it until tonight."

His expression does something complicated—hope and disbelief and overwhelming relief all at once.

"You mean that?"

"I mean it. You're the best thing about this summer. Maybe the best thing that's ever happened to me. And I'm terrified because you're real and this matters and you could actually hurt me. But I'm more terrified of never trying."

"I'm not going to hurt you," he says fiercely.

"You can't promise that. Real things hurt sometimes. But I think..." I take a breath. "I think being hurt by someone who matters is better than spending your whole life safe and alone."

Jamie lifts my hand and presses a kiss to my knuckles—gentle and reverent and perfect.

"I should finish the last story now," he says.

"How does it end?"

"Happily." His smile is real, the one that transforms his whole face. "Definitely, absolutely happily."
