# Chapter 8: The Great Scavenger Hunt

The scavenger hunt teams are posted outside the mess hall after breakfast, and I scan the list with mounting dread. When I find my name, my stomach drops.

**Team 7: Lily Palmer & Jamie Sullivan**

"No," I mutter.

"What's wrong?" Betty appears at my shoulder, then follows my gaze. "Oh. Oh! You got paired with Jamie!"

"This is a disaster."

"Or it's fate." She grins. "You two have been spending a lot of time together lately."

"Against my will."

"Is it though?" Before I can argue, Betty points to her own name. "I got paired with Susan Chen. She's super competitive, so we're definitely going to lose. At least you have Jamie—he's creative."

"He's chaotic."

"Same thing, sometimes."

I'm still staring at the list when Jamie himself appears, looking entirely too pleased.

"Well, well. Looks like we're partners, book girl."

"Don't sound so happy about it. I'm sure this wasn't my first choice either."

"Harsh." He doesn't look offended though. If anything, his grin widens. "Come on, we might actually win this thing."

"How? You probably didn't even read the rules."

"Don't need to. Scavenger hunts are about creativity and speed, not rules." He steers me toward where Mrs. Morrison is handing out lists. "Trust me, I've got this."

That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

---

Mrs. Morrison explains the rules to the assembled teams. We have two hours to collect as many items as possible from the list. Some are straightforward (a pinecone with exactly ten scales, a smooth stone from the lake), others more creative (a photo of your whole team doing a handstand, a counselor's autograph, something that makes you laugh).

"Standard scavenger hunt rules apply," Mrs. Morrison says sternly. "No stealing from other teams, no going into off-limits areas, and absolutely no dangerous stunts." Her eyes land on Jamie for that last part.

"Who, me?" he asks innocently.

"Yes, you. I'm watching, Mr. Sullivan."

Teams disperse to plan their strategies. Jamie and I find a spot under a pine tree to review the list.

"Okay," I say, pulling out a pencil. "We should organize these by location. All the items near the lake first, then work our way toward the cabins, then—"

"Or," Jamie interrupts, "we just wing it and grab whatever we see."

"That's not a strategy."

"Sure it is. It's called opportunistic chaos."

"That's called losing."

He laughs. "You want to win?"

"If we're doing this, we might as well try."

"Then we do it my way. Your way is too slow—while you're organizing by location, other teams will be grabbing the easy stuff." He taps the list. "We need to think like the hunt organizers. What did they make hard on purpose? That's where we have an advantage."

I hate that he makes sense. "Fine. What's hard?"

"This one—'something that makes you laugh.' That's subjective, which means most teams will waste time debating it. We grab the first funny thing we see and move on." He scans further. "And this—'a counselor's sock.' That requires actually getting into counselor territory, which means charm or sneakiness."

"And you have both?"

"I have enough." He grins. "Come on, partner. Let's show these people how it's done."

Against my better judgment, I let him lead.

---

The first fifteen minutes are chaos. Jamie spots pinecones and counts scales without slowing—"Nine, doesn't count"—then another—"Twelve, nope"—finally succeeding on the third try. His way is faster than my careful method.

"Photo of the whole team doing a handstand," Jamie reads. "Can you do one?"

"Against a wall, maybe."

"Good enough." He positions us against the equipment shed, hands his camera to a passing camper. "On three. One, two—"

I kick up, using the wall for balance. Jamie does the same. We hold it maybe three seconds before I topple, laughing.

"That counts," Jamie declares. "Next!"

We race through easier items—smooth stone from the lake, a wildflower, something blue (my hair ribbon, sacrificed).

Then we hit a riddle: *"Where campers sleep but don't dream, find something that's always in between."*

I stop, thinking. "The cabins. That's where campers sleep—"

"But don't dream," Jamie finishes. "Because we're awake during the day. So we need something that's between cabins."

"The paths?"

"Or the trees. Or..." He snaps his fingers. "Cabin numbers! They're between the cabins—cabin seven is between six and eight."

It's brilliant and I tell him so. He looks ridiculously pleased.

We sprint to Pine Grove and grab a fallen piece of wood with a faded "7" painted on it—probably an old cabin marker. Back to the list.

"Counselor's sock," I read. "How are we supposed to get that?"

Jamie's grin turns mischievous. "Leave it to me. But I need you to distract them."

"Distract who?"

"The counselors. They're all in the mess hall planning tonight's activities. You go ask Michael some long, complicated question about swimming. I'll sneak into the counselor cabin."

My face heats. "Why Michael?"

"Because you'll actually talk to him, and you'll be nervous, which means the conversation will naturally run long." Jamie is already moving toward the counselor cabins. "Give me five minutes."

Before I can argue, he's gone.

I walk to the mess hall on reluctant feet. Michael is indeed there, talking with Dorothy and two other counselors. When he sees me at the door, he smiles.

"Lily! Taking a break from the scavenger hunt?"

"Actually, I have a question. About swimming technique." I'm making this up as I go. "I'm having trouble with my breathing rhythm. On freestyle? I keep getting water in my mouth."

It's not entirely a lie—I did get water in my mouth once—but it's definitely strategic.

Michael launches into an explanation about head positioning and breath timing, demonstrating the motion with his arms. I nod and ask follow-up questions, hyperaware that I'm doing exactly what Jamie predicted. But it's working—Michael is fully engaged, the other counselors have gone back to their planning, and I'm successfully distracting.

After exactly five minutes, I see Jamie through the window, giving me a thumbs up.

"That makes so much sense," I tell Michael, maybe too enthusiastically. "Thank you! I should get back to the hunt."

"Good luck! You and Jamie make a good team—I saw you two strategizing earlier."

I'm still processing those words as I jog back outside. Jamie is leaning against a tree, looking smug, dangling a sock from one finger.

"Got it. Let's go."

"Where did you—"

"Robert Fletcher's cabin. He leaves his laundry everywhere. Technically I'm doing him a favor by—"

"Don't need details." But I'm grinning. "What's next?"

We tackle the rest of the list with increasing efficiency. My careful reading of clues complements his wild improvis ation. When we need to solve a riddle about camp history, I remember details from orientation. When we need to convince someone to do something ridiculous for a photo, Jamie's charm works perfectly.

We're laughing by the time we reach the final challenge: get the whole team across a roped area without touching the ground.

"This is impossible," I say, examining the setup—two ropes stretched between trees about eight feet apart, nothing but dirt in between.

"Nothing's impossible." Jamie studies the trees, the ropes, the angle of the sun. "Okay, here's what we do. You're lighter than me. I'll brace myself between these two trees and make a bridge. You crawl across my back."

"That's ridiculous."

"That's creative. Big difference."

He positions himself between the trees, feet on one rope, hands gripping the other, creating a kind of human bridge. It looks unstable and possibly dangerous.

"Jamie—"

"Trust me."

And somehow, impossibly, I do. I climb carefully onto his back, distributing my weight as evenly as possible. He holds steady, muscles shaking but strong, and I scramble across to the other side.

"Made it!" I'm breathless and exhilarated.

"I'm stuck now though," Jamie points out. "Can't let go without touching the ground."

I look around and spot a fallen branch. "Grab this. Use it to pull yourself to my side."

He does, swinging across hand-over-hand on the branch like some kind of crazy gymnast. When he lands beside me, we're both grinning like we've just pulled off a heist.

"We actually did it."

"Told you to trust me."

We race back to the finish line, items in hand, and Mrs. Morrison checks our list with raised eyebrows.

"Pinecone with ten scales—check. Photo of handstand—check. Counselor's sock—" She holds up Robert's sock suspiciously. "Where did you get this?"

"Found it," Jamie says innocently.

"Mmhmm. And this wooden number seven?"

"Old cabin marker, ground by Cabin Seven," I explain.

She works through the whole list, and when she finishes, she actually smiles. "Congratulations. You two are currently in first place."

"What?" I look at Jamie. "Really?"

"Really. Though the hunt isn't over for another hour. Let's see if anyone else can match your score."

We find a spot to wait, collapsing on the grass near the mess hall. I'm sweaty and my hair is falling out of its ponytail and I can't stop smiling.

"That was amazing," I admit.

"We were amazing," Jamie corrects. "Your organized thinking, my creative chaos—turns out we make a pretty good team."

"Don't let it go to your head."

"Too late."

An hour later, Mrs. Morrison announces the final scores. We won. Team 7—Lily Palmer and Jamie Sullivan—beat twenty other teams.

At lunch, Betty slides in next to me, grinning. "You won! I knew you two would work well together."

"It was luck."

"It was teamwork," Jamie says, appearing with his tray. "Admit it, Palmer. You had fun."

I did. More fun than I've had since arriving at camp, maybe more than I've had in months. And it's confusing and unexpected and entirely because of the boy I was convinced was my enemy a week ago.

"Maybe a little," I concede.

His grin is triumphant. "I'll take it."

As lunch continues and other teams relive their scavenger hunt failures and successes, I catch myself laughing at Jamie's increasingly embellished retelling of our victory. Betty watches us with knowing eyes, but I ignore her meaningful looks.

This doesn't mean anything. We're just two people who happened to work well together on a camp activity.

Except when Jamie catches my eye across the table and winks, my stomach does a flip that has nothing to do with the questionable lunch meat.

Oh no.

This might mean something after all.
