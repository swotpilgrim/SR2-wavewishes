# Chapter 7: The Reading Spot Invasion

I discover the perfect hideaway completely by accident.

After lunch, desperate to escape the noise of the mess hall and Betty's well-meaning questions about Jamie, I wander along the lakeshore in the opposite direction from the main dock. The path narrows, becomes less maintained, then almost disappears into tall grass and wildflowers.

Just when I'm about to turn back, I see them: a cluster of large, flat rocks jutting out over the water, hidden from the main camp by a bend in the shoreline and screened by cattails and tall grass. The rocks form a natural platform, sun-warmed and perfect for sitting. The view is beautiful—open water, the far shore with its line of pine trees, dragonflies darting over lily pads.

It's absolutely perfect. Private, peaceful, and far enough from camp that no one will think to look for me here.

I settle onto the flattest rock, pull The Secret Garden from my pocket, and let out a breath I didn't know I was holding. This is what I came to camp for—not socializing or swimming lessons or confusing conversations by campfires, but moments like this. Just me, my book, and the quiet sound of water lapping against stone.

I read for maybe an hour, lost in Mary Lennox's discovery of the hidden garden, before I hear footsteps in the grass behind me.

My stomach sinks even before I look up.

Jamie Sullivan emerges from the tall grass, carrying a worn sketchbook under one arm and looking entirely too pleased with himself.

"Seriously?" I close my book with more force than necessary. "How did you find me here?"

"Followed you." He says it so casually, like stalking people is a perfectly normal activity. "I saw you sneak away from the mess hall and got curious."

"So you followed me? That's creepy, Jamie."

"I prefer 'observant.'" He looks around at my spot, nodding approvingly. "Nice find. I've been looking for a quiet place away from camp for days."

"Well, this is my spot. Find your own."

"Does it have your name on it?" He walks over to examine the rocks, testing them with his foot like he's planning to stay.

"I was here first."

"And the rocks don't care." He sits down on a flat stone about six feet from mine, far enough to not be crowding me but close enough that leaving would seem childish. "Look, it's a big rock formation. Plenty of space for both of us."

I glare at him. After last night's campfire conversation, I'm not sure what we are anymore—not quite enemies, not quite friends, definitely not people who share secret hideaways.

"I came here to be alone," I say.

"So did I."

"Then you should leave."

"Why should I leave? You got here like an hour ago. I've been looking for a spot like this all week."

"An hour ago means I was here first!"

"By that logic, the dragonflies were here before both of us. Should we leave so they can have it back?"

I open my mouth to argue, then realize he's actually making a fair point, which is infuriating.

We sit in tense silence. I try to go back to my book, but I'm hyperaware of him sitting there, shifting slightly, getting comfortable on his rock. After a minute, I hear the rustle of pages. A glance shows him opening his sketchbook.

More silence. The only sounds are water, dragonflies, and the occasional turn of a page. It's almost peaceful, except for the simmering annoyance that my perfect hiding spot has been invaded.

Curiosity eventually wins.

"What are you drawing?" I ask despite myself.

Jamie doesn't look up. "The lake."

"Obviously. But what specifically?"

He tilts his sketchbook so I can see. The drawing is... actually good. Really good. He's captured the far shoreline with surprising detail—individual pine trees, the way the shadows fall on the water, even the lily pads in the foreground. It's not a perfect artist's rendering, but it has life to it, personality.

"Wow," I say before I can stop myself.

Now he looks up, one eyebrow raised. "Is that approval? From the girl who thinks I do everything wrong?"

"I didn't say—" I stop. "It's good. You're good at this."

"Thanks." He goes back to his sketch, adding shading to the tree line. "I like drawing. Keeps my hands busy."

"And your mind?"

He glances at me, something shifting in his expression. "Yeah. That too."

I remember what he said last night at the campfire about drawing keeping him from thinking too much. There's a story there, layers to Jamie Sullivan that I'm only beginning to see.

"Did you take art classes?" I ask.

"Nah. Just something I picked up. When you're stuck in places you don't want to be, you find ways to escape." He adds a few more lines to his drawing. "Kind of like how you read."

The comparison settles over us, an understanding we haven't named yet. We're both hiding, just using different methods.

"What are you reading to avoid?" he asks, nodding toward my book.

I consider lying, but after last night's conversation, it seems pointless. "Everything. Home. The fact that I don't fit anywhere. The uncomfortable reality that camp is exactly as hard as I thought it would be."

"Even after my stellar advice last night?" He grins, but it's not mocking. "I thought I solved all your problems."

"You told me I'm wasting my summer on a fantasy. That's not exactly problem-solving."

"It's problem-identifying. Solving comes next." He sets down his pencil. "So have you thought about it? What I said?"

"I haven't thought about anything else."

"And?"

I look out at the water, trying to find words for the confused tangle in my head. "I don't know. Part of me knows you're right—Michael is never going to see me that way. But the other part doesn't know how to stop wanting him to."

"Why do you want him to?" Jamie asks. "Seriously, I'm curious. What is it about Michael Grant that has you so hooked?"

"He's..." I trail off, searching. "He's kind. And patient. And beautiful."

"Lots of people are kind and patient. Some are even beautiful, though that's subjective."

"It's more than that. He's safe."

"Safe how?"

The question digs deeper than I want to go, but I find myself answering anyway. "Safe because he'll never actually notice me. So I can't be disappointed when he doesn't."

Jamie is quiet for a long moment. When he speaks, his voice is gentler than usual. "That's the saddest thing I've ever heard."

"Thanks."

"I'm serious. You're settling for safety over actually trying? That's—Lily, that's no way to spend a summer. Or a life."

"Easy for you to say. You're not afraid of anything."

He laughs, but it's hollow. "I'm afraid of plenty. I'm just loud about hiding it."

I turn to look at him properly. He's still sketching, but there's tension in his shoulders, in the way he's gripping the pencil.

"What are you afraid of?" I ask.

"Being forgotten. Being exactly as worthless as my parents think I am. Spending my whole life causing trouble because at least it's better than being invisible." He looks up, meeting my eyes. "Sound familiar?"

It does. Uncomfortably so.

"We're not the same," I say, but without conviction.

"No? You hide in books and quiet corners. I hide in pranks and noise. But we're both hiding. The only difference is volume."

He's right. I hate that he's right.

We fall back into silence, but it's different now—less antagonistic, more companionable. I return to my book, and he continues sketching. The sun is warm on my arms. A fish jumps somewhere out on the lake. Time passes in a way that doesn't feel urgent or forced.

After a while, Jamie speaks without looking up from his drawing. "For what it's worth, I don't think you're invisible."

"You followed me here. That's different from noticing me."

"I've been noticing you since I ruined your book. You think I cannonball off docks and crash swim classes randomly? I knew exactly where you were both times."

I stare at him. "That's creepy, Jamie."

"Or it's paying attention." He finally looks up, and his expression is surprisingly serious. "You're interesting, Lily Palmer. You're smart and careful and you notice things other people miss. You're also terrified of being seen, which makes you miss the fact that some people are actually looking."

My chest tightens. "Why are you looking?"

"Because you're worth looking at." He says it simply, matter-of-factly, like it's the most obvious thing in the world. "Even if you don't think so."

I don't know what to say to that. No one has ever called me worth looking at. I'm the invisible girl, the bookworm, the one who fades into the background while prettier, more confident girls shine.

"I should get back," I say, standing abruptly. "Betty will wonder where I am."

"Running away again?"

"I'm not—" I stop. "I'm not ready for this conversation."

"Fair enough." Jamie closes his sketchbook. "But Lily? This spot isn't big enough for both of us to hide in. One of us is going to have to start being visible eventually."

"And you nominate me?"

"I nominate both of us." He stands too, tucking his sketchbook under his arm. "How about a deal? I'll try to cause less chaos if you try to be less invisible. See what happens."

"That's a terrible deal. You love chaos."

"And you love invisibility. Doesn't mean it's good for us." He starts to walk past me, then pauses. "Same time tomorrow? We can hide together and call it progress."

Despite everything, I smile. "Maybe."

"I'll take it."

He disappears back through the tall grass, leaving me alone with my thoughts and The Secret Garden. I should feel annoyed that he's claimed half my perfect hiding spot. Instead, I feel something else—something lighter, more hopeful.

Maybe Jamie Sullivan isn't just a troublemaker who ruins things.

Maybe he's someone who sees things other people miss.

Including me.

I settle back onto my rock and open my book, but the words don't hold my attention the way they usually do. I keep thinking about sketchbooks and visibility and the way Jamie said I was worth looking at, like it was a fact instead of a kindness.

The dragonflies dart over the water. The sun warms my skin. And for the first time since arriving at Camp Silver Lake, I think maybe—just maybe—this summer might surprise me after all.
