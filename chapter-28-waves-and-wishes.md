# Chapter 28: The Final Bonfire Approaches

Two days left.

The camp buzzes with bittersweet energy as everyone prepares for the end. Girls exchange addresses, promising to write. Boys make elaborate plans to meet up back home that probably won't happen. Counselors hand out memory books for signatures.

I wake up on the second-to-last day with an ache in my chest. I came to Camp Silver Lake counting the days until I could leave. Now I'm desperate for time to slow down.

Betty finds me at breakfast. "You okay? You look sad."

"I don't want to leave."

"Because of Jamie?"

"Because of everything. Because I'm different now than when I arrived, and going home means being the old invisible me again."

She links her arm through mine. "You don't have to be. You can choose to stay different."

"It's easier here. At home, nobody sees me anyway."

"Then make them see you. Use your new brave-Lily skills." She bumps my shoulder. "Plus, Jamie's only three hours away. You'll have weekend visits to look forward to."

If he doesn't get sent to military school. If his parents don't decide he's too much trouble. If logistics don't make everything impossible.

But I don't say that. I just smile and nod and try to believe her.

Jamie finds me after breakfast. We've been spending every possible moment together, storing up memories before reality intrudes.

"Mrs. Morrison announced the final bonfire for tonight," he says. "Last one of the summer."

"I know."

"Will you sit with me? Like, officially sit with me? Public couple moment?"

"Haven't we been doing that already?"

"Yeah, but the final bonfire is different. It's the big goodbye, the last camp memory. I want you beside me for it."

"I'll be there."

We spend the day together. Swimming one last time at the lake. Hiking the trail we first walked during the scavenger hunt. Visiting all the places that became ours over the summer—the spot by the rocks, the dock, the path between activities where we'd "accidentally" run into each other.

At lunch, Michael stops by our table.

"Lily, I wanted to thank you again for all your help with the talent show. You were amazing with the lighting."

"Thanks, Michael."

"If you ever want to do theater tech in high school, you'd be great at it. You've got good instincts."

It's a genuine compliment from someone who was kind to me all summer. And I feel nothing but appreciation.

"I'll think about it."

After he leaves, Jamie grins at me. "Look at you. Talking to your former crush without breaking into hives."

"He was never my crush. Not really. He was my safety net."

"And now?"

"Now I don't need a safety net. I have you."

"Damn right you do."

In the afternoon, I help Betty and our cabin-mates pack. We're not leaving until tomorrow afternoon, but everyone's getting ready, labeling trunks and sorting through eight weeks of accumulated stuff.

Betty holds up a lanyard. "Remember making these during week two?"

"I remember being terrible at it."

"You were! But you kept trying because Jamie was at the next table making fun of everyone." She grins. "You were so annoyed by him."

"I was not annoyed. I was... aware."

"You were annoyed. And intrigued. And trying very hard not to notice him noticing you."

She's not wrong. Even then, I was aware of Jamie. I just called it annoyance instead of interest.

"What about you?" I ask. "Did you meet anyone special this summer?"

"Nah. I'm saving my dramatic romance for next summer. This year was all about watching yours unfold." She winks. "Best entertainment I've had in years."

"Glad I could be amusing."

"You were more than amusing. You were inspirational. Watching you go from hiding behind books to actually living? That was beautiful."

Her words make my throat tight. "You helped. You kept pushing me to participate, to be social. I would have hidden all summer if not for you."

"That's what friends do. Push each other to be braver." She hugs me suddenly, fierce. "I'm going to miss you, Lily Palmer."

"I'll miss you too."

"You better write me. I want updates on the Jamie situation."

"I'll write. I promise."

As dinner approaches, the camp takes on a nostalgic quality. Everything feels like "the last time"—last dinner in the mess hall, last walk to the bathhouse, last sunset over the lake.

Jamie and I meet at our spot by the rocks before the bonfire.

"You ready for this?" he asks.

"No. Yes. I don't know." I sit on my usual rock. "I'm not ready for camp to end. For us to go back to real life where logistics are complicated and your parents might send you away."

"Real life is going to be hard," he admits. "But we knew that going in. We chose this anyway."

"I'm scared."

"Me too." He takes my hand. "But I'm also sure. About you, about us, about wanting to make this work. Even if it's hard, even if we have to write letters and steal phone calls and wait weeks between visits. You're worth it."

"You're worth it too."

We sit in comfortable silence until the bell rings for the bonfire.

"This is it," Jamie says. "Last bonfire of the summer."

"Last night as counselors-in-training."

"Last night before everything changes."

"Everything already changed," I point out. "We just have to hold onto it now."

He stands and pulls me up. "Then let's make this last night count."

We walk to the bonfire circle hand in hand. The entire camp is gathering—counselors, campers, even Mrs. Morrison. The bonfire is already burning, huge and bright against the darkening sky.

Log benches circle the fire, and people are claiming spots. Betty waves us over, but Jamie leads me to a different bench—right in front, center circle, where everyone can see.

"You sure?" I whisper.

"Completely sure. I want everyone to know you're mine and I'm yours."

He sits and I settle beside him, close enough that our legs touch. His arm comes around my shoulders, warm and solid and public.

Betty gives me a thumbs-up from across the circle. Sparky grins and elbows Jamie in that boy way that means approval. Even Mrs. Morrison notices and nods, a slight smile on her usually stern face.

This is real. We're real. And everyone can see it.

Mrs. Morrison stands to address the camp.

"Campers, counselors, friends—this is our last night together at Camp Silver Lake. In the morning, you'll pack your trunks. Tomorrow afternoon, buses and cars will arrive to take you home. But tonight, we're still here, still together, still a community."

Her voice carries over the crackling fire.

"I want you to remember this summer. Not just the activities or the awards, but the people. The friendships you made, the challenges you faced, the ways you grew. Camp is where we learn who we can be when we're brave enough to try."

I feel Jamie squeeze my shoulder.

"You came here as individuals. You leave as part of something bigger—a community that saw you, knew you, helped you become more than you were. Take that with you. Remember what it felt like to be seen, to matter, to belong."

Her eyes sweep the circle, landing briefly on me and Jamie.

"And remember that the courage you found here doesn't have to stay here. You can be brave at home too. You can choose connection over safety, honesty over hiding, real relationships over easy ones. That's the real lesson of camp—not how to make a lanyard or paddle a canoe, but how to be brave enough to let people see who you really are."

The camp is silent, everyone absorbing her words.

"So tonight, sing loudly. Laugh with your friends. Make these last hours count. And tomorrow, when you leave, take the magic with you."

The crowd erupts in applause. Someone starts singing "Kumbaya," and others join in. Voices blend in the darkness, harmonizing around the fire.

Jamie leans down to whisper in my ear. "She's talking about us."

"About everyone."

"Yeah, but especially us. Two people who learned to stop hiding and be real." He kisses my temple. "Best summer of my life."

"Mine too," I whisper back.

We sing through all the classic camp songs. "Fire's Burning," "Make New Friends," "Taps." Songs I'll probably never sing again, but will remember forever because they're tied to this place, this moment, this feeling of belonging.

Between songs, people share favorite memories. Sparky talks about the epic water balloon fight of week four. Betty describes the comedy sketch that killed at the talent show. A younger camper tearfully thanks Mrs. Morrison for being patient when she was homesick.

And through it all, Jamie's arm stays around me, solid and real and perfect.

As the fire burns lower, as voices get quieter, as the night deepens toward true goodbye, I lean into Jamie and breathe in this moment.

Tomorrow we leave. Tomorrow reality begins.

But tonight, we're still here.

Together.

And that's enough.
