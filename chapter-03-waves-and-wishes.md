# Chapter 3: The Troublemaker's Introduction

The second morning at Camp Silver Lake dawns bright and already warm, promising a hot June day. I skip breakfast in the mess hall—too loud, too many people, too much forced cheerfulness—and grab a muffin from the basket by the door on my way out. Betty calls after me, something about swimming assessment at ten, but I pretend not to hear.

I have a mission: reclaim the dock.

Last night's peace was the first moment since arriving that I felt like I could actually breathe. If I can start each morning there, alone with my book before the day's mandatory activities begin, maybe this summer won't be unbearable.

The camp is quieter this early. Most girls are still at breakfast or getting ready in their cabins. I pass a few counselors setting up activity stations, but they don't pay attention to one quiet girl heading toward the water. The morning air smells like pine and dew, and mist still hovers over the lake's surface, giving everything a dreamy, peaceful quality.

Perfect.

I reach the dock and walk to the end, sitting in the same spot as yesterday. The wood is damp with morning moisture, but I don't care. I pull Jane Eyre from my pocket—I've taken to carrying it everywhere, like armor—and open to where I left off.

The mist is lifting slowly, revealing the far shore and the perfect reflection of trees in the still water. A bird calls somewhere in the pines. The page in front of me blurs slightly as I relax into the moment, the tension in my shoulders finally releasing.

This is what I came for. This makes it bearable.

I read for maybe ten minutes, lost in Jane's world, before I hear it—footsteps running on the dock, the wood planks creaking and bouncing with the impact. I look up just in time to see a figure sprint past me.

"No, wait—"

The boy launches himself off the end of the dock in a spectacular cannonball, knees tucked tight, arms wrapped around them. For one suspended second, he's airborne against the blue sky.

Then he hits the water.

The splash is enormous. Water erupts in all directions, a wall of it surging over the dock, over me, soaking me completely. My book—my precious, beloved Jane Eyre—takes the full force of it. Water streams off the pages, making the ink blur and run.

"No!" I gasp, but it's too late. The book is drenched, the pages already warping.

The boy surfaces about ten feet from the dock, shaking water from his dark hair like a dog, grinning like he's just accomplished something wonderful. He's maybe seventeen, with the kind of lean, athletic build that comes from being naturally active rather than deliberately muscular. His hair is almost black when wet, and his eyes—even from this distance—are bright with mischief.

He notices me for the first time, and his grin widens.

"Morning!" he calls cheerfully, treading water.

I can't speak. I'm staring at my book, watching the water drip off it, feeling my heart crack. This wasn't just any copy of Jane Eyre. This was my mother's, from when she was young, before she became the tight-lipped, disappointed woman I know. It was one of the few things she'd given me that felt like it mattered.

And now it's ruined.

The boy swims to the dock ladder and hauls himself up with easy grace. Water streams from his rolled-up jeans and white t-shirt. He's not wearing shoes—of course he's not. He probably doesn't care about rules like "no swimming without a counselor present" either.

He walks toward me, still grinning, and that's when he sees my expression.

"Oh. Hey, are you okay?"

I hold up the book, water literally pouring from it. My hands are shaking. "You—you ruined it."

"It's just water. It'll dry." He reaches for it, and I snatch it away.

"Don't touch it!"

"Easy there. Let me see." Before I can stop him, he plucks the book from my hands, holding it up out of my reach. He's tall enough that even when I stand, I can't reach it.

"Give it back!"

"Jane Eyre?" He reads the cover, water still dripping from the pages. "Huh. Heavy reading for a Tuesday morning."

"It's not funny. That was my mother's book. It's—it was—special." My voice cracks on the last word, and I hate myself for it. I will not cry in front of this careless, thoughtless boy who destroys things without even noticing.

Something shifts in his expression. The grin fades slightly. "Oh. I didn't—I mean, I didn't know anyone was on the dock."

"Maybe look before you cannonball off things!"

"Maybe don't sit at the end of a dock if you want to stay dry?" The grin is back, defensive now.

I stare at him, fury rising in my chest. "I was here first. I was reading. Peacefully. Bothering no one. And you just—you destroyed it."

He turns the book over in his hands, examining the damage. Water drips onto the dock. Some pages are stuck together, and the spine is already warping. He wrings water from the bottom edge, which makes it worse.

"Stop! You're making it worse!"

"I'm trying to help."

"You've helped enough."

"Look, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't see you." He holds out the book, and I grab it back, cradling it against my chest even though it's soaking my blouse. "I'm Jamie. Jamie Sullivan."

"I don't care what your name is."

"Wow. Okay. What's yours?"

"None of your business."

"Fiery. I like it." He grins again, and I want to push him back into the lake. "You're new, right? I haven't seen you before."

"This is my first year. My first two days, actually, and you've already ruined them."

"That's a little dramatic. It's a book. It'll dry out, the pages will be wavy, but you can still read it."

"It's not just a book," I say through clenched teeth. But I can't explain why—can't explain about my mother, about how this book was the only thing she'd shared with me in years, about how it represented some version of her that maybe used to exist, before disappointment and fighting and cold silences took over. He wouldn't understand.

He tilts his head, studying me. "You really are upset."

"Yes!"

"Sparky! Come on!" A voice calls from the shore. I look past Jamie to see another boy, shorter and stockier, waving from the beach. "We're gonna be late for breakfast!"

"Yeah, yeah, coming!" Jamie calls back. He looks at me again, and for just a second, something almost apologetic crosses his face. "Look, I really am sorry about your book. I'll—I don't know, I'll get you a new copy or something."

"It won't be the same."

"No, I guess not." He starts to walk past me, then pauses. "What were you reading about, anyway? What's so great about Jane Eyre that you're out here at—" he glances at the sun "—like eight in the morning?"

I stare at him. Is he seriously asking about the plot right now?

"It's about a girl who doesn't fit anywhere," I say finally, "who survives by being invisible and not expecting anything good to happen. And then people keep interrupting her peace anyway."

Jamie laughs—actually laughs. "That's not what it's about. It's about a girl who stands up to everyone who tries to keep her small. She doesn't stay invisible. She makes herself matter."

I blink. That's... actually a fair reading of the text. How does this careless boy who cannonballs off docks without looking know anything about Jane Eyre?

"You've read it?" I ask despite myself.

"English class last year. Hated most of it, but Jane was okay. Feisty." He grins again. "Kind of like you."

"I am nothing like you described me."

"Sure you are. You're standing here yelling at me instead of running away crying. That's feisty." He winks—actually winks—and then jogs off the dock toward his waiting friend.

I stand there, dripping, clutching my ruined book, trembling with anger and confusion. The peaceful morning is destroyed. My book is destroyed. And somehow I've just had a conversation about Victorian literature with a boy who seems to think destroying other people's property is funny.

"Sullivan!" I hear the other boy—Sparky, apparently—say as Jamie reaches him. "Who's that?"

"No idea. Didn't get her name. Reads too much." Jamie's voice carries across the water, not quite mocking, but not kind either.

They disappear up the path toward the mess hall, and I'm alone again.

I sink back down onto the dock and carefully open my book. The pages are stuck together. The ink has run in places. The spine will never be straight again. It's readable, but it's ruined.

I should have stayed in my bunk. I should have known that trying to find peace would backfire. Good things don't last. Quiet moments get destroyed. People like Jamie Sullivan crash through life not caring what they ruin in their wake.

I peel apart two stuck pages as gently as I can and smooth them flat. The words are still legible, mostly. I can still read it. But it will never be the same.

Just like camp. I thought maybe I could carve out small moments of peace—morning reading sessions, quiet evenings, days where I could stay invisible. But if boys like Jamie Sullivan are here, boys who don't respect boundaries or personal space or other people's property, then I can't even have that.

The mist has fully lifted now. The lake sparkles in the morning sun, beautiful and indifferent to my frustration. Somewhere in the distance, I hear the bell for activity sign-ups.

I carefully close my book and stand. My blouse is soaked, my shorts damp. I probably look ridiculous. And I still have to face a full day of swimming assessments and forced social interaction and pretending I'm having the "best summer of my life."

All I want is to be invisible. To read my books and not be bothered.

Is that really too much to ask?

Apparently, at Camp Silver Lake, with boys like Jamie Sullivan around, it is.

I walk back up the path toward Cabin Seven, leaving wet footprints on the dirt, my ruined book clutched against my chest. The day has barely started, and it's already terrible.

Fifty-four more days to survive.

Somehow, that number feels a lot bigger than it did yesterday.
