# Chapter 27: Choosing Reality Over Fantasy

I wake up early, before the rising bell. Sunlight streams through the cabin windows, and I lie in my bunk feeling different.

Not tired despite barely sleeping. Not anxious about the day ahead. Just... different. Changed.

Betty's still asleep below me, and the other girls are quiet lumps in their bunks. I climb down carefully, dress quickly, and slip outside into the cool morning.

The camp is beautiful at this hour—dew on the grass, mist rising off the lake, everything peaceful and new. I used to hate mornings at camp, always wishing I could sleep later. But this morning feels special.

This morning, I'm not hiding anymore.

At breakfast, I don't scan for Michael first. I don't time my arrival to coincide with when he usually shows up. I just get my tray and look for Betty, and when I spot Jamie across the mess hall, my heart does that flip that's becoming familiar.

He sees me at the same moment and his whole face lights up.

Betty notices. "You're staring at him."

"I know."

"Publicly. Where people can see."

"I know."

"This is new." She grins. "I like this version of you."

Jamie catches up to us as we're leaving. "Morning."

"Morning," I say, and there's something in the air between us, something that feels charged and significant.

Betty looks between us. "Okay, I need details. All the details. What happened last night after you ran out?"

So we tell her. Not everything—some moments are just ours—but enough. The dock, the tears, the book of stories, the confessions.

"I knew it!" Betty practically shouts. "I've been telling you for weeks that he likes you, and you've been telling me I'm crazy, and I was right!"

"You were right," I admit.

"Say it again."

"Betty, you were right."

"One more time."

"Don't push your luck."

She laughs, triumphant. Then she turns to Jamie. "If you hurt her, I will personally make your life miserable. Just so we're clear."

"Crystal clear," Jamie says, but he's smiling. "Though for the record, she could hurt me just as easily."

"Good. Mutual destruction potential. That's how you know it's real."

We spend the morning together, not hiding it. We sit side by side at the lake during free swim. We partner for a camp-wide scavenger hunt rematch. We hold hands walking between activities, and if people notice—and they do—neither of us cares.

At lunch, Michael and Dorothy sit at their usual table. Michael catches my eye and waves, friendly and warm. I wave back, and there's no pain. No longing. No wishful thinking about what might have been.

Just genuine appreciation for someone who was kind to me all summer, even if he never knew how I felt.

After lunch, Dorothy approaches me while I'm clearing my tray.

"Lily, can we talk for a minute?"

My stomach tightens. "Sure."

We step outside, and she leads me to a quiet spot near the arts and crafts building.

"I wanted to say something," Dorothy starts. "About last night. I saw you run out after Michael's announcement, and I realized... you didn't know. About us."

Heat floods my face. "I feel like an idiot."

"Don't. You're sixteen and he's handsome and kind. It makes sense." Her expression is gentle. "I knew you had a crush on him. Michael did too, actually. We talked about it a few times, trying to figure out if we should say something or just let it run its course."

The humiliation is overwhelming. "Everyone knew."

"A few people noticed. But Lily, nobody was laughing at you. If anything, people thought it was sweet. First crushes usually are."

"I wasted my whole summer."

"Did you?" She tilts her head. "Because from what Jamie tells me, you spent your summer becoming friends with him. Learning to be seen. Growing braver. That doesn't sound like a waste to me."

"Jamie told you?"

"He's been working in my arts space for weeks, making that book. We talked a lot." She smiles. "He cares about you. Really cares. And from the way you two were holding hands this morning, I'd say that's not one-sided."

"It's not," I admit. "I just wish I'd figured it out sooner. Instead of pining for someone who was never..."

"Available? Interested? Right for you?" Dorothy finishes gently. "Michael's great, but he's also twenty and in a serious relationship and seeing you as a helpful camper. Jamie's seventeen and single and completely head over heels for you. One of those was always going to work out better."

She's right. Michael was never a real option. Jamie was right here all along.

"Thank you," I tell Dorothy. "For being kind about this. You could have been really mean."

"Why would I be mean? You didn't know about us, and even if you had, having a crush isn't a crime." She squeezes my arm. "I'm happy for you and Jamie. You're good for him. He's been creating beautiful things all summer instead of causing chaos. That's because of you."

After she leaves, I find Jamie at our spot by the rocks. He's sketching in a small notebook, and when he sees me, he closes it quickly.

"Spying on my artistic process?"

"Always." I sit beside him. "Dorothy just talked to me."

"Yeah? What did she say?"

"That everyone knew about my crush on Michael and nobody was laughing at me, which I'm choosing to believe even though it's mortifying." I lean against his shoulder. "And that you've been creating beautiful things instead of causing chaos, which is apparently my fault."

"It is your fault. Completely." He puts his arm around me. "You made me want to be better."

"You were always good. You just hid it."

"We both did." He kisses the top of my head. "But we're done hiding now, right?"

"Right." I take a breath. "Jamie, I want to do this. Really do this. Not just for the next few days at camp, but after. Letters and phone calls and visits when we can. I want to try."

"Even though I might be sent to military school? Even though we'll be three hours apart or more?"

"Even though. Because you're worth it. This is worth it."

He turns me to face him, his expression serious. "I need you to understand something. I'm not easy to care about. I cause trouble and push boundaries and have this whole family situation that's a mess. Loving me—caring about me—it's not going to be simple."

"I don't want simple. I want real." I cup his face. "I want you, complications and all. Your messy family, your tendency to cause chaos, your fear of being unwanted. All of it. That's who you are, and that's who I'm choosing."

His eyes are bright. "You're sure?"

"I'm terrified. But yeah, I'm sure."

"Okay then." He grins. "Guess you're stuck with me."

"Good."

We spend the afternoon together, openly, not caring who sees. We help younger campers with a craft project. We sit together at the campfire sing-along. We take a canoe out on the lake and don't tip it over even once.

As the sun sets, we find ourselves back at the dock.

"This is our place now," Jamie says. "Every time I think about this summer, I'll think about this dock."

"Me too." I lean against him, watching the water turn gold and orange in the setting sun. "Two more days. Then we go home."

"Then we figure out what comes next."

"Together."

"Together," he agrees.

And sitting there on our dock with the sun setting and the summer almost over, I'm not scared anymore.

I'm ready.

Ready for reality instead of fantasy.

Ready to be seen instead of invisible.

Ready for whatever comes next, as long as Jamie's beside me.

The waves lap gently at the shore, and somewhere in my chest, something that's been clenched tight for years finally relaxes.

This is what choosing reality feels like.

And it's better than any fantasy I ever imagined.
